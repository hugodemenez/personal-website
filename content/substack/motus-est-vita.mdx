# Motus est vita

<Date date="2025-04-23T15:15:18.170Z" />


In life, we pursue dreams.

Once we achieve those dreams, we have new ones. That’s what creates momentum.

Momentum is what pushes us to live, to thrive.

**Dreams that carry us forward**

I have so many dreams today. I hope I would always have dreams.

One thing I can recommend: talk about your dreams when you wake up. Share them. Reflect on them. Force yourself to remember the ones that visit in sleep and the ones that rise during the day.

Every thought is important.

Every thought is memorable in its way—bad, good, inspirational, motivational… any.

# **Looking ahead with hope**

In a few months, I’ll be a father.

It’s a new kind of dream. One that’s not just mine.

I want my daughter—my children—to grow up inspired to chase whatever lights them up. No matter what.

Dreams are important. That’s what makes us feel alive. Grumpy, sad, desperate—and still, somehow… hopeful.

# **Keep dreaming**

Keep dreaming, guys.

Let those dreams keep you in motion.

Let them make you feel alive.
