# Burning in

<Date date="2025-04-13T12:20:20.782Z" />


I took two weeks off.

But during those two weeks, I couldn’t really rest.

My mind stayed at work. Thinking about features to build. Answering messages from customers. Worrying about money.

By the time I got back from Portugal, I felt more tired than when I left.

## **Slow relief, but not enough**

I started muting my phone. Deleted some apps. Cancelled a few subscriptions.

It helped.

A little.

But the constant low-level anxiety? Still there. Still humming beneath everything. I call this state "burning in" — the slow kind of burnout where nothing explodes, but everything smolders.

## **Months of tension**

Since January, I’ve been selling my product. Running ads. Pushing features.

I hit 30 paying customers this April. That should feel like progress. And it does. But it also feels... heavier than expected.

I thought this would be easier.

## **A lesson about dependencies**

One major drag: I planned a real-time market chart feature based on a 3rd party data source. But they delayed. And I got stuck waiting.

Big mistake.

Better approach? Build a minimum viable version with whatever's available. Launch it. Then improve it later with 3rd parties.

Don’t wait. Don’t rely. Work around.

## **Holidays need real silence**

Next time I take a break, I’ll turn off everything. Messages. Notifications. All of it.

Rest isn’t real if you’re still plugged in.

## **The missing habit**

Also, I stopped running.

Bad idea.

Exercise helps. Not just physically, but mentally. It gives me air. Clears my head. Breaks the worry loop.

It’s not the whole solution. But it’s part of it.

## **The real takeaway**

Burnout doesn’t always come loud. Sometimes it just simmers.

So pay attention. Turn things off when you can. Move your body. Make room for silence.

It’s not weak to rest. It’s smart.
