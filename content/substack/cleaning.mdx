# Cleaning

<Date date="2025-09-04T12:26:13.812Z" />


Have you ever felt that little itch to just clear everything out? Not just the usual quick tidy-up, but a proper deep clean that shakes things up?

I’m talking about fall cleaning. The kind where you don’t just dust the shelves but actually sort through the chaos in your life and space. It’s a weirdly satisfying feeling, like hitting refresh on your whole day.

I’m right in the middle of it now.

Moving into a new place, setting up a new workspace, and suddenly all those little piles of papers, digital files, and random stuff staring at me feel like old baggage I’m ready to drop.

It’s not just about making things look neat. It’s about creating space. Not just physically but mentally too, for something fresh to take root.

## **Why sorting things matters more than you think**

Sorting things might sound mundane, but it’s actually kind of magical.

When your desk is a mess or your room feels cluttered, your brain feels that too.

You waste energy trying to find stuff, and that drags you down more than you realize.

I noticed this right away as I started organizing my desktop files. Each folder neatly named, each document easy to grab, it felt like I was clearing out mental fog.

With a newborn at home, I get how precious time really is. Every minute counts, and losing time to messiness feels like a luxury I can’t afford.

When things are tidy, when you know exactly where everything is, life flows better.

You’re not wasting energy hunting down lost keys or documents. You get to focus on what really matters, like soaking in those small, perfect moments with a tiny human who changes everything.

## **Cutting out the toxic clutter**

Messiness isn’t just about stuff.

It’s about the people and habits that fill your life too.

Toxic humans? They’re like clutter in your emotional space.

Sure, it’s tough to say goodbye, but holding on to them just drains your time and energy.

Imagine your life as a closet: the toxic folks are the old clothes you never wear. Why keep them when they only take up space?

Learning to say “next” and walking away has been one of the most freeing things for me. It’s not about being harsh; it’s about protecting the time and energy you need to grow and breathe. Life’s too short to spend it untangling emotional knots that don’t serve you.

## **Organizing your schedule: the hidden secret to “finding time”**

Here’s a truth bomb: nobody ever really “doesn’t have time.” We all have the same 24 hours. The difference is how we organize those hours. Your schedule is like your desk or your closet: if it’s messy and disorganized, you constantly feel rushed and stressed. But if you keep it sorted and intentional, suddenly there’s room for the things that matter.

It’s about making choices and carving out space for what’s important.

You might say, “I don’t have time to read, to exercise, to call friends.” But if you look closely, those things can fit, if you’re willing to let go of the less important distractions and keep your planning clear.

I’m still figuring this out, but cleaning up my calendar feels just as good as clearing my desk.

So, I’m letting all this sink in while I get back to my sorting and organizing.

It might seem small, but it’s a fresh start: a little breath of air in the middle of everything. And honestly? It’s worth every minute spent.
