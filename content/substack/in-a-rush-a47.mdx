# In a rush

<Date date="2026-01-25T09:45:54.545Z" />


Juggling between work, life, and healthcare isn’t an easy task.

In a few months, I’ll be running 42 km (a marathon), but it feels like I can’t train.

I have priorities right now that make it so easy to say no to a run.

I recently came across this guy,[Adrien Friggeri,](https://friggeri.net) who developed a web app that records all his runs for the last 10 years:

It automatically collects all his data from Strava (I don’t think they have a public API, so I don’t know how he manages all of this, but this is very insightful and motivating).

The design is very minimal; I love it!

He says sometimes he just runs 1 mile to not lose his streak. Lately, there have been a lot of 1-mile runs, and I feel him. It’s difficult to keep momentum, but that makes you feel alive. Once you lose the momentum, it is extremely hard to get back on track (for anything in life).

Let’s face it, we’re all grumpy. We just sometimes have no other choice than to push ourselves forward.
