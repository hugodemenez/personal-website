# Should you look at others?

<Date date="2024-10-26T10:36:40.875Z" />


As we worked on finding product-market fit for App-Prove, it felt natural to look around at the market, understand what competitors were doing, and see how they positioned themselves. But soon, we faced a critical question:*Is it safe to look so closely? Could this end up making us copy or, even worse, repeat their mistakes?*

The risk of following others too closely is real. When you mimic competitors, you might unintentionally adopt the same challenges they’re facing. Instead, we’ve committed to a different approach. We take insights that can inspire, but we’re determined to build in our own way, tackling pain points from a fresh perspective and using our own strengths to stand out. This isn’t about following trends or blending in; it’s about crafting something uniquely ours.

So, should you look at others? Absolutely but do it with intention. That’s how we’re using these insights to shape a product we know will resonate because it’s built to solve the real gaps we found in the market.
