# Pay attention to details

<Date date="2025-12-23T16:14:10.124Z" />


I just finished **[Animations on the web](https://animations.dev/)** by [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/), and I’m already saving up to dive into **[Devouring Details](https://devouringdetails.com/)** by [Rauno Freiberg](https://rauno.me/).

These creators are incredibly attentive to detail and it shows. You feel it in every interaction.

The first person I followed online who truly obsessed over details was [Nanda Syahrasyad](https://www.nan.fyi/).

He created **[Interactive SVG Animations](https://courses.nan.fyi/svg/00-svg-foundations)**, an interactive course on SVGs (a vector format for drawing shapes on the web that never lose quality when scaled).

I was blown away the first time I saw a handcrafted SVG, especially an animated one.

With SVGs, you can animate paths, morph shapes, and achieve effects that are impossible with images like PNGs or JPEGs.

It’s these thoughtful, handcrafted details that make an interface truly stand out.

When I started building **[Deltalytix](https://www.deltalytix.app/)**, my trading journal for futures traders, I wanted to prioritize simplicity and a beautiful UI.

More than a year later, I’m honestly a bit disappointed with how little attention I ultimately gave the visual polish.

As users grew and feature requests poured in, I gradually deprioritized design time.

(Though I never gave up on UX and I actually doubled down on DX.)

UX matters to the masses.

DX matters deeply to me as a solo builder.

**User Experience** is about making the app intuitive and frictionless. I conduct 3–4 user discovery calls every month, observing how people navigate Deltalytix in real time. It helps me uncover pain points, and I often ship fixes within an hour of the call.

**Developer Experience**, on the other hand, is about velocity and reliability. Great DX means iterating faster with fewer bugs.

For instance, early on, I tried building one synchronization system to rule them all platforms. It quickly proved impossible. So I refactored the codebase: now, adding support for a new trading platform takes just 20–30 lines of code.

That single change has saved me countless hours (even with today’s AI tools), reduced bugs dramatically, and made maintenance a breeze.

I’m sharing this as a reminder to myself (and maybe to you): in the rush to ship features, it’s easy to let the magical details slip. But those details (from subtle animations to pixel-perfect interactions) are what turn good products into unforgettable ones.

Inspired by Emil, Rauno, and Nanda, I’m committing to bringing more of that devotion back into Deltalytix in 2026.
