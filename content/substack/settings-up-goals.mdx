# Setting up goals

<Date date="2024-01-29T15:26:23.894Z" />


I recently [read a book](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective/dp/3319155237) discussing the effectiveness of objectives.

In this book, authors suggest that not having a clear objective often yields better results than having one. They specifically mention machine learning, proposing that algorithms trained through “random exploration” are more effective.

However, I found completing the book challenging due to a perceived misunderstanding by the authors about rewarding paths in machine learning.

Contrary to their view, a machine learning algorithm typically cannot conduct “random exploration” without a specific goal. Such an approach is rarely beneficial, resembling the aimless observation of behavior without clear outcomes, similar to Conway's Game of Life.

The book also appears misleading in its failure to acknowledge the developer's objectives. The authors assert that a bipedal robot learns to walk faster without a specific goal than with one. Yet, in practice, the robot enhances its walking ability by aiming to travel further in each training session, following a rewarding path based on the most successful outcomes.

If you never highlight any objective, then how do you know when you reached something interesting?

Let’s explore why having no goal at all is not viable, and why finding a life purpose appears to be extremely important.

In previous writings, I emphasized the value of having a significant project in life. We have already discussed the idea mentioned above, but I want to delve deeper into this intriguing subject.

The authors claim that having no goal opens up numerous possibilities, potentially leading to a better outcome than if one had a precise goal. This isn’t entirely false; consider all the discoveries that might occur. However, I believe this advice is sound only if accompanied by some awareness. On a short timeframe, having no goal for the day isn’t particularly beneficial. Likewise, lacking a life goal over a long timeframe is also not advisable.

But what exactly do the authors mean? When is it beneficial to have no goal?

I interpret the book’s core message as advocating for flexible, rather than fixed, goals. They underscore this by stating, 'Goals might be deceptive’.

In summary, the key takeaway from this book is the adaptability and continual evolution of goals, rather than the absence of any goals.
