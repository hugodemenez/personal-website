# How to find motivation

<Date date="2024-02-18T22:19:18.497Z" />


I have read tons of articles, books, and research on the topic.

Is there a secret sauce? Am I more motivated now than 5 years ago? How do you wake up every day eager to achieve something great?

When I was at school, I always spent time dreaming about what I could do if I had more time to work on my personal project.

Now, I have time… but for the past 3 months, I didn’t feel my motivation. I wasn’t motivated enough, and I knew it.

The fact is that once you feel motivated as hell, you’ll feel much more when you’re not motivated.

Indeed, you put into perspective the motivation you currently have against the motivation you had at its highest peak.

Like we always compare good times with current situation… even if there are regular things 99% of the time and we should put in perspective current situation with average ones.

So… Big question. How do you feel motivated every day?

Focus on your short-term goals, which should be aligned with your long-term ones and so on…

I feel like doing this is working for me.

I don’t care if I am not as motivated as I was yesterday.

The only thing I care about is achieving my goal of the week to achieve the goal of the month, which may ultimately put me closer to my yearly goal and so on…

Planning is the key!

Do what you love, don’t overthink and never be ashamed of not being the best.

Just the fact that you’re going on, puts you further than yesterday. Feel proud about who you are and what you are doing.

Thanks for reading
