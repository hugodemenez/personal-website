# The fire inside

<Date date="2025-04-18T08:43:23.295Z" />


Some people can’t leave an idea alone.
They’re the ones firing things up—not with noise, but with a quiet obsession.
The kind of minds that take apart toys just to understand what’s hidden beneath the surface.

## **Not great, but going anyway**

Drawing didn’t come easy.
Neither did handwriting.
But there was determination.
The kind that shows up in the slow, left-handed kid who practiced until the work was not only neat, but praised.
Classmates asked for help writing out shared assignments—not because of speed, but because the final result looked like it mattered.

A beautiful page earns attention.

It’s worth the effort.
Put all your odds in your favor.

## **Creating over perfecting**

Building matters more than polishing.
The thrill comes from turning a thought into something real.
Whether it’s digital or physical doesn’t matter.
What matters is the act of creation.

Make things.
Break things.
Make them again.

## **The fire isn’t loud**

There’s a campfire in the gut.
A small but steady flame that says: this needs to be made.
It might already exist.
Doesn’t matter.
There’s still a reason to build it your way.

Call it passion.
Call it the fire inside.

Everyone should create with passion.
That’s how useful, amazing things are born.
Don’t chase money.
It’s a fine motor.
But passion is the real driver.

Let the fire burn.

Quietly.
Persistently.
Always forward.
