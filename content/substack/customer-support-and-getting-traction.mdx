# Customer support and getting traction

<Date date="2025-01-17T18:16:12.606Z" />


As I made my first “marketing” move last week by conducting an interview, I noticed something remarkable. Customers started coming in. This small step marked a significant shift.

Right from the start, I made a promise: every customer would receive extreme care.

## **The importance of customer support**

Today, customer support feels like it’s on autopilot. Most systems are too automated. There’s a lack of genuine attention.

When someone reaches out, they want to feel heard. They want more than a chatbot or a generic email reply.

I knew this early on. But deep down, I also realized something critical. Maintaining that level of service forever? It’s easier said than done.

## **Scaling challenges: from 10 to 50 customers**

In just two weeks, my customer base grew from 10 to 50. Exciting, right? But with growth came new challenges.

Handling ten customers personally is doable. Fifty? That’s a different story. It became clear: I needed a team.

## **Things that beed to be fixed**

Growth demands development. I see so many areas where improvements are essential:

>

> 1.**> Automated Roadmap:**> Customers deserve updates. A system where I can easily use markdown files to update the roadmap would help.

> 2.**> Better Stripe Webhooks:**> My database doesn’t update if trial periods change in the Stripe dashboard. That’s a problem.

> 3.**> Specialized Roles:**> I need experts—a UI/UX researcher, a designer, and even someone to handle marketing. These aren’t optional.

## **Streamlining processes**

The idea of streamlining has always appealed to me. Every step should be simple and clear.

For example, when a customer sends a message with a greeting, the response is usually the same. Why not automate it? A database webhook could trigger that message through a provider like Resend.

It’s about making things efficient without losing the personal touch.

## **The balancing act**

While automation is essential, the goal isn’t to eliminate personal interactions. It’s to free up time for meaningful connections.

As growth continues, I’ll focus on building systems that ensure customers feel valued. Every interaction matters.

Scaling is tough. But with the right mix of tools, processes, and people, it’s possible to grow without losing what makes your business special.
