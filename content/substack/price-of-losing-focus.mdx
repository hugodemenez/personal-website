# Price of losing focus

<Date date="2024-12-15T11:51:51.745Z" />


The past year has been a rollercoaster, rough yet rewarding, frustrating but enlightening.

It started with a project I loved. I was immersed in programming, crypto, and trading. A perfect combination for someone who loved problem-solving and learning.

But then, something unexpected happened.

I started feeling slow, ineffective at coding. This was before AI tools like Cursor were available.

Instead of confronting the core issue, I searched for distractions that felt productive.

First, I decided to learn **vim**.

Then, I changed my computer setup, switching to a QWERTY keyboard, convinced it would make me faster.

My focus continued to slip. I rationalized it all as “optimization.”

Soon, I decided I needed to audit my code, thinking it was critical for selling software.

None of these detours solved the issue.

## **Where focus disappeared entirely**

In the middle of my programming struggles, I pivoted drastically.

I co-founded a **cybersecurity startup** with a friend, despite having only surface-level knowledge of the field.

It felt exciting, like stepping into a new arena full of challenges and possibilities.

For nine months, I poured energy into this venture.

I learned about startups, honed my networking skills, and had deep conversations with over 25 people on calls, building connections that remain valuable to this day.

Yet, there was a growing sense of discomfort.

Was this really what I wanted?

## **Paying the price for clarity**

By early September, I knew I was stuck.

I was working on a project I didn’t enjoy, juggling ideas without focus, and feeling mentally jammed.

I made the decision to hire an entrepreneurial coach.

It was a $3000 investment that felt daunting at first.

Aurelien, my coach, guided me through this haze with tough but meaningful questions. He helped me reconnect with what I truly wanted:

>

> To build and create things I love.

Over the weeks, I met incredible people through his network who challenged my thinking and clarified my path.

## **Rediscovering my passion**

Through it all, one thing remained constant:** trading.**

Every day, I showed up to trade with a talented mentor. I found immense satisfaction in the rhythm of trading, combining programming and financial analysis.

Trading might carry a bad reputation for many:

>

> • “It’s just gambling.”

> • “It creates no real value.”

> • “You’ll lose money.”

Yet, I love it.

**Trading is an art.**

It’s about patience, resilience, and, most importantly, risk management.

In trading, you evaluate risks in real time, sometimes within seconds, and adapt.

It reminded me of survival instincts: like ancient humans assessing danger in the wild.

Risk management is a skill that translates to life, and trading has sharpened mine.

**mastering self-control**

Trading also taught me self-control. Early on, I realized I was calm in ordinary situations, but under stress, my emotions could flare up. Trading forces you to confront this head-on.

Managing a losing trade, resisting impulsive decisions, and staying level-headed: these challenges transformed me.

You don’t learn this from theory. You learn it from experience, often painful, but always valuable.

## **The takeaway**

The past year showed me the **cost of losing focus.**

I spent months chasing distractions and new ventures that didn’t align with my passions. But the journey wasn’t a waste. It taught me what truly matters:

>

> clarity, resilience, and the courage to stick to what I love.

Now, I’m back to building things that excite me. Programming and trading remain at the heart of my journey. And as I move forward, I’m committed to staying focused, because losing focus is too expensive a mistake to repeat.
