# Find your target

<Date date="2024-03-15T15:41:04.781Z" />


It has been a while since my last writing... I had started writing this one a long time ago but didn’t find the inspiration and thoughts to finish it. Now, after some time and reflection, along with some motivation from a good friend of mine, I delve into it with you.

# Where it started

I often find myself talking alone or finding someone who’s willing to listen and ask questions. It is known to be extremely valuable to discuss with anyone, ask questions, and make them ask questions.

Recently, I talked with a friend and told him what I just realized.

In the summer of 2023, I decided I would become good at running. I haven't practiced any sports during my higher degree studies apart from school badminton (it has been almost 10 years).

Why am I telling you that?

Well, because it brought some ideas, and I got one I want to share.

A few runs back... I was running (well, that’s the purpose of a run)... I was not at my fastest pace at all. In the dark, I discerned a guy running up a hill far away. I decided I would use it as a target.

So I cranked up and ran faster. In the end, I reached the target and went by. But once I passed the target, I realized I was slowing down.

Then I realized, in life, it works the same.

You have to quickly bounce back and find a new target to go further. However, in the current situation, I had no similar target on my track.

## That’s where Mario kart kicked in

I started to imagine a ghost vision of a runner in front of me. This helped me to go further.

Thanks to this mental trick, I managed to reach my running Personal Record on 5k.

## Dreaming

This experience made me realize that in life you have to envision your goals to push you further. If you can’t dream it, that’s going to be harder.

Bernard Arnault, one of the 3 richest men in the world, said recently:

“Dreaming is good for business”

This resonates a lot with me, hope it does for you.
