# Life

<Date date="2025-07-12T18:09:11.601Z" />


There’s a strange kind of joy in feeling completely drained.

Like you’ve given everything you have, and even then, it feels good.

It’s not tired in a bad way. It’s the tired that comes from pushing yourself, from making progress.

That’s where I am right now.

My business is growing, even though I’m “almost” away. I say almost because I’m still here in the background, coding features when I can, answering customers, and juggling everything else life throws at me. Moving home, preparing to become a father soon... it’s a lot. But all of it feels alive and real.

It’s hard to picture what life will look like in just three or four weeks.

Hopefully finished work at home, a baby girl arriving, a new chapter unfolding. The unknown is exciting and a little scary, but… mostly exciting

## Balancing work and life

The challenge of balancing business and life is real.

I am working hard on several fronts at once.

On one side, the business needs coding, customer support, and new ideas.

On the other, there’s the move and the soon-to-be father role, which demand energy and presence.

Sometimes, I catch myself thinking about how I’ll manage to keep up once the baby arrives. Will I still have time to code? Will I respond quickly enough to clients?

The truth is, I don’t have all the answers yet but I’m learning to trust the process.

This phase feels like running a marathon and sprinting at the same time. Exhausting but exhilarating. It’s about finding small moments to contribute meaningfully, even when time is scarce.

## New business opportunities ahead

On the business front, I’m exploring something new.

I’m developing tools for private companies like hedge funds and proprietary trading firms. These companies manage groups of traders and need ways to track their performance closely.

My goal is to create a management dashboard which will help these firms spot areas that need improvement quickly. It will also highlight top traders who perform exceptionally well so that the firms can support them live.

This new tool could open a fresh stream of income.

I already have some potential clients lined up and others who might be interested soon. It feels promising, like planting seeds that will grow over the coming months.

## Looking forward

In about a month, life will look very different:
-

The work at home will be done.
-

A baby girl will be part of the family.
-

The business will have new directions to explore.

It’s hard to fully imagine all these changes, but the excitement is undeniable.

Challenges like these keep life interesting. They push me to grow, to adapt, and to find new ways to give my best. The combination of personal milestones and business growth feels like a perfect storm of opportunity.

I’m ready to face what’s coming, even if the days get long and the nights short. Because in the end, it’s all part of the journey I want to be on.

## Conclusion

Feeling drained isn’t always a bad thing. Sometimes, it means you’re fully alive, giving your all to what matters most.

Right now, that’s where I am: tired but happy, busy but hopeful.

Life is about juggling many parts at once, it’s about moving forward even when the path isn’t clear and it’s about welcoming change with open arms, no matter how challenging it might be.

What’s coming next is unknown, but that’s part of what makes it so exciting.
