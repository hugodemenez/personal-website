# How to build a "good" product?

<Date date="2024-11-23T14:19:25.961Z" />


I started writing this thought two weeks ago. But today, I stumbled upon a LinkedIn post announcing a new startup.

Their product launch was marketed using two AI-generated videos of people talking to each other and “SOLVING YOUR PROBLEMS.”

I lost faith in the product the second I saw that video content.

So, let’s talk about building a *good*product.

## **what does it replace?**

The foundation of a good product lies in understanding what it replaces.

Ask yourself:*What role does this product fill?*

If there’s already something on the market, why are you building this? Is your version faster, cheaper, easier, or simply more delightful?

If the product doesn’t yet exist, dig deeper:

Why hasn’t it been created before? Was it irrelevant? Technologically impossible? Did it have no market? Why are you the one who can bring it to life now?

## **what will people leave behind?**

Every good product asks its users to make a trade-off.

For example, when people bought a smartphone for the first time, they gave up their cameras, standalone phones, MP3 players, and physical notebooks.

When someone buys the latest iPhone, they leave behind their current smartphone—one with a lower-quality camera, less battery life, or outdated design.

A product must be compelling enough that people willingly let go of something familiar.

Ask yourself: What will your users leave behind?

The greater the *perceived value*, the more likely they’ll make the switch.

## **how hard is it for them to switch?**

Switching to a new product isn’t just about desire—it’s also about the *friction*.

>

> • Is your product affordable enough?

> • Does it solve problems without creating new ones?

> • How seamless can you make the transition?

A good product is designed to minimize the effort required to adopt it. Offer guidance, create easy onboarding, and address the barriers that might hold people back.

Think about this as pulling someone away from a strong current. What can you do to reduce the force tugging them in the opposite direction?

Indeed, you might say I haven’t built the “perfect” product yet.

But if you keep these questions in mind—what your product replaces, what users leave behind, and how hard it is to switch—you’ll be much closer to creating something *good*.
