# Just showing up isn't enough

<Date date="2024-10-30T08:09:00.993Z" />


During my last year of engineering school, I made a promise to myself: I’d show up for every class. I stuck with it, no matter how early, no matter how tired. But here’s the thing: this level of dedication wasn’t the norm for me. Most of my school years were different. So, why specify my *last year*?

Because, before then, I only showed up when I felt it mattered. For classes where the professor read directly off slides, barely acknowledging us, I started to question why I was even there. If the teacher was only going to read out the same notes we already had, what was I really gaining? I wasn’t alone in feeling this way, either. Some classmates agreed, but many still showed up. They’d sit there, zoning out, present in body but not in mind.

This idea of simply “showing up” without really engaging or contributing? It’s everywhere. When I started working, I saw the same trend in some colleagues. They’d be at their desks every morning, scrolling through emails, attending meetings, and just floating through the day. It was as if they’d mastered the art of “looking busy” without actually making any impact. By the time they were wrapping up to go out for the next after-work event, I’d already left, having completed my work hours earlier.

**The problem with the “show-up” culture**

Seeing this behavior at work made me think of Elon Musk’s drastic layoffs at Twitter. When he cut almost 80% of the workforce, I understood why. Large companies often end up with people who are “just there.” They check off tasks, attend meetings, but rarely push anything forward in a meaningful way.

And here’s part of the problem: endless distractions. With apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook, people’s attention spans are shrinking. Many of us get so used to jumping from one five-second video to the next that we lose the ability to focus deeply on anything. And let me be clear: I’m not saying this out of judgment. I used to scroll through social media all the time. I was on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. It wasn’t until later that I recognized the hold these platforms had on my time and my mind.

I get it; distractions are addictive. I went through a similar struggle with gaming, putting in over 2,000 hours on Counter-Strike alone. It took time, but I eventually broke free from that, realizing that it was keeping me from what I actually wanted to achieve.

**Showing up isn’t the same as contributing**

Here’s the main point: showing up isn’t enough if you’re not actually engaged or doing meaningful work. I know that sometimes simply being present can create opportunities. But it’s pointless if you’re mentally checked out. In the corporate world, there’s often this pressure to go to every meeting, every social gathering, every networking event. But what’s the point if you’re just there to be seen, not because you genuinely care?

I’ve had conversations about this with friends, and we all see it, just being visible for the sake of it doesn’t really bring value. People eventually notice when someone is going through the motions. And, in the long run, it doesn’t benefit anyone, least of all yourself.

**Make every choice count**

You have control over your actions. If something doesn’t feel meaningful to you, don’t feel pressured to show up. Use that time and energy for things that align with your goals and values, things that actually matter to you.

> Life’s too short to waste time on things that don’t contribute to your growth or happiness. Don’t just go along for appearances or because “it looks good.” Put your effort into what moves you forward, what fulfills you. Showing up can be valuable, but only if it has purpose.
