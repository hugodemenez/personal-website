# From concept to kitchen

<Date date="2023-11-22T17:41:45.381Z" />


This article discusses my experiences in developing a product, emphasizing the challenges of making progress when there's widespread skepticism about convincing customers of the product's necessity. It also explores the complexities of innovating in a market that steadily shrinks over time and offers insights into finding motivation while working independently.

## Going back to the roots

As I grew up,I began going to the grocery store on my own, transitioning from selecting food from the fridge to actively choosing ingredients for cooking.

> In northern France, the norm is to have establishments known as hypermarkets, akin to Walmart. The concept originated in France with Carrefour and was subsequently adopted by Auchan. I am particularly familiar with Auchan, as it was founded by the Mulliez family in the 1960s, with deep roots in my local city of Roubaix-Croix.

Getting to the crowded grocery store was not a pleasing experience. I realized that going to corner stores like butcher, fishmonger, greengrocer presented a significantly better alternative. The benefits include expert recommendations and a more serene shopping environment. This realization led me to going to the butcher once a week where I not only received valuable guidance but also discovered that I could get better quality products at the same cost.

## The dry aging process

Exploring the butcher shop introduced me to the world of dry-aged meat.

Dry aged meat is a unique culinary experience. To put it simply, we take a piece of meat, preferably with a layer of fat, and place it in a special fridge. This fridge isn't your usual one : it's a smart appliance that keeps an eye on humidity, temperature, and the weight of the meat. This monitoring triggers a chemical reaction that breaks down the meat fibers, making it tender and giving it a nutty flavor.

While not every butcher offers a dedicated dry-aged cabinet, the one I frequented had an expansive fridge showcasing a diverse range, from Normande and Black Pearl to Irish beef.

However, dry-aged meat is much more expensive than regular one ranging from 2x to 3x price increase. It is quite obvious, since the butcher has to take care of the dry-aging time, shrinkage of the meat and also the reimbursement of the dry aging cabinet.

## Where engineering background shines

This sparked my engineering curiosity like [Alex in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toVCDq94Fa8). We both realized that we might be able to create our own dry aging appliance and quickly get a return on our investment since we only had to buy regular meat (which is much more affordable).

That’s how I have been dreaming about dry aging appliance, filling patents and tinkering for the past 2 years. I strongly believe that leveraging new technologies can significantly cut down the costs associated with existing appliances, such as [Dry Ager](https://www.dry-ager.com/en/) cabinets which typically start at a minimum of $2000 and are primarily designed for professionals.

## Skepticism and motivation, keys to success

I encountered individuals expressing skepticism, stating that this concept had no future and that the rise of veganism would adversely impact my market. Despite these opinions, I firmly believe that people will continue to consume meat for the foreseeable future. While there may be a shift towards reduced meat consumption, which aligns with my product's promotion, this doesn't pose a concern for me.

I find satisfaction in encountering skepticism about my idea, as it provides an opportunity to challenge the concept and fortify my motivation. I am motivated to prove doubters wrong and demonstrate the true potential of my innovation.

For the next year, I will be truly dedicated to this project, sharing my progresses and findings through this blog. Consider subscribing to follow my journey!

Here is a quick insight about the next blog post :

# Hub of success

In the upcoming blog post, I delve into the powerful influence my grandfather had on my perception of success. As the leader of a moving company founded by his father, he introduced me to the business world from a young age. Memories of navigating the warehouse and steering small trucks atop my grandfather's legs at the age of 4 left an indelible impression. This early exposure instilled in me the belief that achieving remarkable feats was within reach.

However, a surprising revelation awaited me as I explored the roots of success. It turns out that Bernard Arnault, a prominent figure in the business world, was raised in the same locale where I grew up, between Croix and Roubaix in the north of France. This unexpected connection adds a fascinating layer to the narrative, demonstrating that greatness can indeed spring from familiar beginnings.
