# Building with purpose

<Date date="2025-02-01T10:21:09.579Z" />


Through my Harvard studies, I have learned that products should solve pain points.

We have to focus on this and not get distracted by other ideas.

Initially, I built this new product to solve my own pain points.

Storing my data in the cloud. Auto-importing my data into the spreadsheet. Visualizing daily metrics on a calendar widget.

It was all for me at first.

But with a growing user base, I’ve identified new pain points.

**"I can relate to."**

Those last words have a huge impact on the product's success.

If the ones building the product cannot relate to the pain points users experience, keeping up can be difficult.

However, that alone doesn’t make a product.

It helps with user satisfaction because you can quickly identify what is going wrong with your implementation.

That’s why, in the past two weeks, I have been constantly evolving the product.

Targeting the right audience. Keeping it grounded in my own needs.

The product is growing steadily.

I didn’t reach my goal of 10 monthly paying users for January.

But I have already achieved more than I imagined possible after my last startup failure.

I recognize the benefits of such a deceiving experience.

When I started in entrepreneurship, I thought finding customers was easy… it wasn’t even a concern in my mind.

Now my focus is entirely on user satisfaction. Making sure every user finds what they need in the product as it benefits everyone. Even future subscribers.

So I make sure to keep this approach, until the product feels just right… which might not happen right away.

Ahah.
