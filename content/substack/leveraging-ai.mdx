# Leveraging AI

<Date date="2025-03-08T12:28:11.111Z" />


Today, I want to share my thoughts on the incredible new tools powered by AI.

It’s amazing how quickly these tools are developing and changing the way we work and live.

From coding assistants to personalized music recommendations, AI is making our lives easier and more efficient.

I’m excited to dive into my experiences with some of these tools and reflect on their impact.

## Discovering Raycast Pro: A Musical Delight

One tool that recently caught my attention is [Raycast Pro](https://www.raycast.com).

I was looking for inspiration and decided to try its Spotify playlist plugin.

All I did was describe the mood I wanted, and it created a playlist that was nearly perfect.

It suggested jazz pop music that I absolutely love.

I was amazed by how well it understood my preferences.

This experience made me realize just how powerful AI can be in delivering personalized experiences.

## AI in Coding: A Learning Curve

Using AI for coding has been a mixed experience for me.

At first, it wasn’t flawless, and I found myself losing the joy of programming.

I felt like I was just following suggestions without really understanding the code.

But then I had a realization: I am the “chef d’orchestre,” the conductor of the orchestra.

My knowledge of the codebase, the infrastructure, and the architecture is crucial.

AI can be a powerful assistant, but it needs my guidance to produce the best results.

This shift in perspective helped me regain my enjoyment of coding while leveraging AI’s capabilities.

## Streamlining Life with AI: Planning and Photos

AI isn’t just for coding; it’s also great for everyday tasks.

For planning, AI tools help me organize my schedule efficiently.

They suggest optimal times for meetings and remind me of important events.

On my iOS device, the photo management features are awesome.

I can search for specific photos using natural language, and AI finds exactly what I’m looking for.

These tools save me time and make my life more organized.

## Grok: My Go-To LLM

When it comes to large language models, my choice is [Grok](https://grok.com).

What sets Grok apart is its ability to reflect on its own thoughts through the reflect option.

This makes interactions feel more natural and insightful.

Plus, its data sources are accurate, which is crucial for reliable information.

And the best part? It’s free with my X subscription, which is a fantastic bonus.

Grok has become an indispensable tool for me.

## Conclusion: Embracing the AI Future

Reflecting on these experiences, it’s clear that AI is empowering us in numerous ways.

From personalized music recommendations to efficient planning and advanced language models, AI tools are making tasks easier and opening up new possibilities.

While there are challenges, like finding the right balance in coding, the benefits are undeniable.

I’m excited to see how AI will continue to evolve and enhance our lives.

I can’t wait to set up Raycast Pro fully, using it to correct my grammar, improve my blog posts, and schedule meetings with a simple keyboard shortcut.
