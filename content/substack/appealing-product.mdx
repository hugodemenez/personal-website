# Appealing product

<Date date="2025-02-08T12:29:42.406Z" />


I once believed in the saying that a good product will make for itself.

By that, I thought I had to show off the true value of the product first and then tell its price.

It made sense in my head. If people see the value, they’ll pay. Simple, right?

## The first experiment

I started by making the product free.

No barriers. Just pure access to value.

Then, I introduced a pricing plan. A Plus option with a 3-day trial.

Three days didn’t feel like enough, so I increased it to seven.

To start the trial, people had to put in a payment method.

## The decline

At first, things looked okay. Then, adoption started to slow down.

I assumed people didn’t want to enter their payment details.[I found an article highlighting this issue](https://userpilot.com/blog/credit-card-vs-no-credit-card/). Turns out, it’s a common problem.

So, I decided to test something else.

For two weeks, I removed the requirement.

Adoption cranked up. It felt great.

But I don’t have solid numbers to prove this feeling. That’s when I realized something important.

## The metrics problem

As I write this, I see I am missing key metrics.

Or maybe I have them but don’t monitor them.

I had to chase down my clients and ask why they didn’t enter their payment method.

I suspect the main reason is simple. They didn’t have a way to add it.

## The fix

For the past three days, I’ve been working on a proper subscription management page.

A place where users can see their plan, manage payments, and make decisions easily.

I’m still figuring out what should be displayed.

Should I add a quick cancel button? Or should I use a dark pattern to keep users around?

## The conclusion

A good product should always work out. That’s the new saying I’m going with.

We’ll see how it goes.
