# Experimenting

<Date date="2025-11-22T13:04:25.728Z" />


I often find myself in periods of experimentation, a week or two during the year where I can deep dive into a specific topic.

It is extremely interesting and fulfilling to me.

Experimenting opens new doors to my future. It’s like discovering a new set of ideas/knowledges.

Lately I spent a lot of time on tech topics: caching / performance improvements.

I revamped my personal website with those experiments https://hugodemenez.fr

I wanted my whole site to live updates with my latest work. As I often publish content on various platforms like YouTube, x, LinkedIn and Substack, I thought it would be awesome to gather all this data to live update my website.

I learned about simulate streaming, caching (cache components with NextJS 16 and redis) and finally everything related to large language models UI (generative interfaces, tool management and user feedback)

Looking back, these weeks of tinkering aren’t just hobbies; they’re investments in myself. They spark ideas that bleed into my work, my videos, everything. It’s honest exploration, no pressure, just curiosity leading the way.

If you’re feeling that itch, try it. Pick a topic, block off time, and see where it takes you. Who knows what doors you’ll open? For me, it’s already reshaping how I share my world online.
