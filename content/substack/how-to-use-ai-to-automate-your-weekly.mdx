# How to Use AI to Automate Your Weekly Grocery Shopping

<Date date="2025-09-27T21:15:38.870Z" />


Picture this: It's Sunday evening, and you're staring at your empty fridge while scrolling through endless categories on Grocery store’s website.

You're trying to remember what you actually need, second-guessing quantities, and inevitably forgetting that one essential item that will force you into another shopping trip mid-week.

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

Despite the promise of digital convenience, online grocery shopping often feels more tedious than wandering physical store aisles. The endless clicking, searching, and decision fatigue turn what should be a simple task into an hour-long ordeal.

But what if I told you there's a way to reduce your weekly grocery shopping to just 2 minutes?

Comet, the browser automation tool that's about to revolutionize how you approach online shopping.
