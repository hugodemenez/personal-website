# Nothing is perfect

<Date date="2025-05-25T10:47:17.270Z" />


I just stumbled upon this new Dyson innovative vacuum “PencilVac” and it inspired me to write those lines.

We create every day.

Everything you produce is a creation.

Whether it’s an email, a sketch, a business plan, a piece of furniture, or the way you handle a conversation. It’s all part of what you’re shaping in the world.

When you’re making something, think it through.

Then make it as good as you possibly can.

Not to impress anyone. But because it’s yours.

You’ll never hit perfect. But if you aim for it, you end up with something solid.*** Something that matters***.

And when you make it count, people notice. They might not always say it. But it sticks.

Even more important

If you give your best, it shapes *you*.

You’re sharpening your own tools. You’re building taste, stamina, discipline.

Sure, some things aren’t worth perfecting. We all cut corners where it makes sense.

But when you *create*: really create! Why not try to make it beautiful? Why not give it your full attention?

That’s not perfectionism. That’s growth. That’s how things get better.
