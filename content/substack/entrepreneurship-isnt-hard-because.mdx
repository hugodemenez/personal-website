# Entrepreneurship isn't hard because of the work.

<Date date="2025-05-15T10:11:49.440Z" />


When I first stepped into entrepreneurship, I thought I’d have a valuable product and investors lining up in 6 to 8 months. LOL. What an idea.

I didn’t realize then that building is the easy part.

Creating something people actually value? Harder.

But here’s the twist:

not only do you have to create value, you have to *convince others*that value exists.

And that’s the part no one warns you about.

# **Feeling stuck is part of it**

There was a point where I felt stuck. Maybe even desperate, though I wouldn’t have said it that way at the time.

It felt more like being stuck in wet cement: you can move, but just barely.

I hadn’t talked to a single user. Not one. I figured if I needed the product, other people would too. That should’ve been enough.

It wasn’t.

# **You can’t do it alone**

Even if your idea comes from personal need, building in isolation will slow you down.

You need people around you: excited, skeptical, honest people.

Not because they’ll always give you great advice (they won’t), but because they’ll help you pressure-test what you’re doing.

The discussions, debates, and even disagreements will sharpen your vision.

# **Stick to the big fish**

One reminder that helped me stay centered: don’t lose sight of your values and vision.

Users will offer suggestions. Lots of them. Some will be gold. Others will tempt you off-course.

It’s like fishing for a marlin but catching sardines every five minutes. Sure, the sardines are easy wins. But they’ll keep you from catching what you’re really after.

Sometimes you need a different hook. Or just more patience.

# **Final thought**

Building something meaningful takes longer than you want, and longer than you planned. The work isn’t what breaks most founders. It’s the waiting, the wandering, and the self-doubt.

But if you keep walking and if you surround yourself with people who challenge and support you, you’ll get there.

Just don’t trade the big fish for a bucket of sardines.
