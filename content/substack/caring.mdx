Taking care of yourself is number one priority on Maslow’s Pyramid

Ever caught yourself pushing your own health to the back burner?

I used to think that just switching up my workspace setup was enough to fix my nagging back pain. But turns out, I was missing something pretty crucial.

Taking care of yourself isn’t just one box to tick on a to-do list.

it’s the foundation for everything else in life, like taking care of your family, your finances, your home. Without your health, nothing else really works as well as it could.

**Why your health is the real base of the pyramid**

Imagine your life as a pyramid: the classic Maslow’s Pyramid (also known as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs), where basic needs sit at the bottom.

At the very foundation, you have your own wellbeing. If that’s shaky, everything else on top feels unstable.

You can’t fully focus on your work, your relationships, or your goals if you’re constantly dealing with pain or stress.

I didn’t realize just how much I was underestimating this.

For years, I struggled with dorsal (upper back) pain. I blamed it on sitting at a desk all day. So, I switched to a standing desk, got a split keyboard, tried a bouncing ball chair, and even invested in an ergonomic seat.

Small changes, right? But none of it really helped. It was frustrating, because I thought I was doing everything “right.”

**The lesson from my osteopath: oil the engine, don’t just fix the wheels**

Visiting an osteopath was a game changer.

The professional told me something that stuck: it’s like trying to drive a car with a rusty engine.

You can swap out tires, change the steering wheel, or polish the paint all you want, but if the engine is rusty, the car won’t run smoothly. Taking care of that engine (your body’s core) is what really makes the difference.

The funny part? My pain wasn’t even coming from my upper back where I felt it.

The root cause was actually tightness and issues in my lower back and butt muscles. It was a surprise, but it made total sense once explained, this is a common example of referred pain, where issues in one area (like the lower back or glutes) can manifest as discomfort elsewhere in the back.

Once I started focusing on that, I could actually benefit from all the ergonomic gear I had bought.

**Professionals can see what we miss but don’t lose your own voice**

This experience showed me how important it is to see practitioners (osteopaths, psychologists, doctors, dentists). They bring expertise and perspectives we might never think of on our own.

Sometimes, a fresh set of eyes and hands can uncover the root cause of problems that have been bothering us for ages.

But here’s a catch: while it’s great to get advice and help, it’s also important not to rely blindly on others.

Always question and challenge what you hear. You’re the expert on your own body and life. Sometimes advice needs tweaking to fit you perfectly.

Listen, learn, but keep your own voice loud.

**Taking care of yourself is a lifelong act of kindness**

In the end, taking care of yourself isn’t just about preventing pain or fixing problems. It’s an ongoing act of kindness to yourself. It’s about making sure you have the energy, strength, and peace of mind to live fully and care for the people and things you love.

So, before rushing to solve everything else, spend some time putting oil in your engine.

Visit a practitioner if needed. Notice what your body and mind are telling you.

And remember: your health is not a luxury. It’s your starting point, the solid ground beneath everything else.

Take care of yourself. It’s the best investment you’ll ever make.
