# The science of simplicity

<Date date="2025-04-28T13:53:07.669Z" />


When you start a project, speed matters. You have to unload your mind fast. Get your ideas out before they rot, mutate, or get crushed by doubts.

At this stage, perfection is your enemy.

The goal is movement, not precision. Sketch wildly. Write badly. Capture whatever surfaces.

# **The second step: focusing**

Once you have that chaotic first draft, something strange happens: a few ideas will start to glow.

You feel it in your gut. This could be something.

That's when you need to focus.

Focus is not a natural state anymore. Distractions are one click away. Entire worlds living inside your pocket.

Focusing is not a switch you flip. It's a skill you cultivate.

# **The hidden trap: complexity creeps in**

Once you're focused, a new enemy appears: complexity.

You start adding features. You start layering "what if" ideas. Your project gets heavier, noisier.

This is almost unavoidable. Complexity and creativity are cousins.

But unchecked, complexity kills focus.

You have to be brutal. Cut. Simplify. Refine.

# **The ongoing battle: staying simple**

Keeping things simple is not a one-time choice. It's a continuous effort.

Every day, you will be tempted to add. To tweak. To "just" adjust something small.

You have to resist.

Simplicity is not the lack of ideas. It's the rigorous selection of the right ones.
