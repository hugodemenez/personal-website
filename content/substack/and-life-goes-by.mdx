# And life goes by

<Date date="2025-08-26T13:07:27.153Z" />


Have you ever caught yourself thinking, “Where did that hour go?”

One moment you’re scrolling, the next you’re wondering how an entire week vanished.

That little surprise… life slipping by faster than you expect is strangely common.

It feels faster as the years pass.

Maybe it’s because our memories stack differently, or maybe it’s because we stop noticing the small, new moments that make time feel long.

Either way, it nudges you to ask: how do we actually enjoy the time we have?

## Time feels different as we age

When you were a kid, summers felt endless.

Now a weekend can feel over before it even starts.

The brain plays tricks: when there are fewer new experiences, time seems to compress. When you try something new, the day fills with details, and time appears to stretch.

So the easy idea is to keep things fresh.
-

Try a different route home.
-

Learn a small skill.
-

Say yes to a random plan now and then.

You don’t need to reinvent your life; just add a few moments that your memory will store as interesting. Those moments slow the rush.

## Being present while planning ahead

How do you stay in the moment when you also have to think about the future? It’s a balance everyone tries to manage.

You want to enjoy the now, but you also need to be ready for what’s next: work, relationships, bills, trips.

It’s normal to feel pulled both ways.

A simple approach is to separate concerns.

Give yourself short zones of full presence: an hour without notifications, a walk without thinking about email.

Then set aside small blocks for planning.

The contrast makes the moments you choose to be present actually feel present.

## Health: the simple engine behind presence

There’s probably no magic trick to slowing time, but there is something close: basic health. (sleep, eat, drink well and practice sport reasonably well). When your body and brain work, you can make memories and stay in control.
1.

If you sleep well, your brain can access long-term memories and focus on what’s happening now. That makes being present easier.
1.

If you eat well, you feel energized and calm, not distracted by hunger or stomach aches.
1.

If you drink enough water, headaches stay away and your head feels clear. A small drink of alcohol now and then can be a social pleasure, but keeping it moderate helps your memory and sense of presence.
1.

If you move regularly, your energy and mood improve, and your body keeps up with the life you want to live.

These aren’t rules to follow perfectly.

They are tiny investments that pay off almost immediately.

Sleep a bit more, eat one thoughtful meal, drink a glass of water, take a short walk. Small actions add up and help you actually enjoy the moments you’re living.

## A few ways to make moments stick

Make a habit of noting one small detail each day: one smell, one sound, one face. Write it down or tell a friend.

The act of noticing helps your brain file the moment away. Travel if you can, but even a day trip or an unfamiliar café can create the novelty that stretches time.

Ask better questions. Instead of “Where did the day go?” ask “What did I notice today?” That shifts attention from loss to presence.

And forgive yourself.

Life will speed up sometimes. That’s normal.

The goal is not to control time but to show up for it when you can.

In the end, life goes by whether you watch it or not. But you can make it feel fuller. Small choices: sleeping, eating, hydrating, moving, and noticing help you collect moments that last.

Which small change will you try this week?
