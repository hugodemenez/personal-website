# Accept you target and focus on the present

<Date date="2025-03-23T12:21:37.792Z" />


This morning, while running, I thought about my targets, both on the road and in my business.

I realized something simple yet powerful: it’s not about hitting the goal today; it’s about the actions I take right now.

### **Running Goals: Steps That Grow**

For the last two years, I’ve been running weekly, two to three times.

At first, my goal was to run 10km in under an hour.

It wasn’t easy, but I got there.

Then I aimed higher: 5km in under 25 minutes. Achieved that too.

Now, I’m chasing 10km in under 50 minutes. Each step builds on the last.

Today, I ran 15km, targeting a 5:30 min/km pace. Halfway through, I knew I wouldn’t hit it. And that’s okay.

Goals aren’t about instant wins; they’re about progress.

### **Business Goals: Dreams That Shift**

My business goals work the same way.

Early on, I dreamed of having 100 paying users for my tool. It was a solid start. But dreams change.

Now, I want to offer the best value for money and keep at least 500 weekly active users. I track this with Posthog, aiming to hold that number steady for three months. Until then, the target’s not mine.

It’s like running. You set the mark, but you don’t obsess over it every second. You adjust as you go.

### **Actions: What Matters Every Day**

Goals are nothing without action. Reflecting on my run and my business, I see it’s the daily steps that count. For my tool, that means a few clear moves:
-

Ensure customer satisfaction by replying to every request in 15 minutes.
-

Add features every two weeks, but only impactful ones at least two users ask for. No clutter.
-

Improve stability by keeping things simple, cutting bugs, and making it easy to maintain.
-

Make partnerships, at least one meaningful tie every two months.

These aren’t fancy. They’re just what works. The list could grow, but I stick to what’s doable now.

### **Wrap-Up: Eyes on Today**

Running and business teach the same lesson: accept your target, but focus on the present.

I won’t hit 10km under 50 minutes tomorrow, and my 500 active users won’t lock in overnight. That’s fine.

By doing the right things today, I get closer. You can too. Pick your goal, then ask: what’s my next step?
