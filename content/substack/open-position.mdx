# Open position

<Date date="2025-11-16T16:43:44.493Z" />


For the past 2 years, I have been applying to remote engineering roles that I dream of.

Working on my own project allowed me to apply to positions I found very interesting, without the urge to find a job.

Sending a new application was like buying a lottery ticket, with some hope that I would get the job.

However, it really felt like lottery… (statistics aren’t on my side).

In the end, I just started to make a list of endless rejection emails.

Rejection is the norm.

I tried to join Hedge funds, big tech companies and even Cursor in the early days.

Reading this article was eye opening to me:

Open roles are not very important to companies. Applying shouldn’t be a thing.

In fact you might just need to find a way to exist and be known by others.

With engineering roles, it is often by building great stuff and sharing it.

I have been sharing the development of deltalytix on a YouTube channel [https://youtube.com/@hugodemenez](https://youtube.com/@hugodemenez) but as I keep it in French I don’t have many views and it doesn’t make ads for me.

This isn’t relevant to anybody except to existing users who need to stay updated about latest improvements / changes.

In the coming days, I’ll try to share more of my work in a way that it shows what I have been tackling and solving.

It is going to highlight my thinking process and dev skills. I still have to try it out and understand what interest people but I’m sure it will help standing out.
