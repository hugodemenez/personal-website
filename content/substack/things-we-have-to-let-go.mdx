# Things we have to let go

<Date date="2025-04-07T10:07:44.952Z" />


I was clearing the grass after a storm in Portugal.

Leaves everywhere. A total mess.

But as I started gathering them one by one, I realized something simple: it’s easier to clean bit by bit than to try and fix everything at once.

This is what focus looks like.

## Focus means saying no

Focus is possibly the most underrated key to getting anything meaningful done.

You can't chase every idea. Not at the same time. And especially not just because they *seem*good in the moment.

Most of the time, success doesn’t come from being wildly creative. It comes from being disciplined. From sticking with one thing long enough to see what it really becomes.

So yes, write the ideas down. Let them live on paper. But let them go for now.

## Don't forget why you stopped

I told my wife during a walk, “I want to start a side project. Not for fun, but maybe it’ll lead to something useful.”

She looked at me and said, “But isn’t that *why*you stopped everything else?”

She was right.

Sometimes our brains go looking for new problems just to stay busy. But if the goal is to give your main project the best shot, then starting another one “just because” can be a trap.

Make space for one thing. Let it grow.

## Use the tools, but use them wisely

We live in a time where you can build a rough MVP in an hour or two. That’s not an exaggeration.

AI makes it possible. But it also makes it tempting to chase too many things.

The challenge isn’t speed anymore. The challenge is focus. Value over volume. Depth over distraction.

If you want to explore an idea, set a timer. One hour, max. Build a rough version. See what happens. Then get back to what matters most.

## Let things go to hold onto what matters

It’s not about ignoring ideas. It’s about respecting your energy.

Your time is your sharpest tool. Use it like one.

Let some things go—not forever, just for now.

And give your best focus to the one thing that really deserves it.
