# Won't you take a break?

<Date date="2024-11-09T09:00:06.921Z" />


*“True success is not the absence of failure; it is the refusal to surrender.”*

This quote got me thinking: does refusing to surrender mean never taking a break? Or can rest be part of the journey?

## **An entrepreneurial circle**

Every week, I join a group of entrepreneurs. There are usually six to ten of us.

We’re a mixed bunch: some have over 20 years of experience, while others, like me, are just starting out.

But we all have one thing in common: each of us is at the beginning of a new project, trying to build something from scratch.

## **Self-care is non-negotiable**

When I first entered the world of entrepreneurship, I expected challenges. But I didn’t realize just how intense they’d be.

The mental load can feel like it’s draining every bit of energy.

To keep my balance, I’ve learned that self-care has to come first.

That means getting good sleep and staying physically active. For me, it’s running almost daily.

Running clears my mind and keeps me grounded.

Some entrepreneurs in our group have faced burnout. It’s a clear reminder: if you want to last, you need to prioritize your health.

Freeman from UC Berkeley reveals that 50% of entrepreneurs report mental health struggles, making self-care essential for sustainability.

## **Winter is coming**

In entrepreneurship, we talk about “winter.”

Winter is that period of inevitable challenges that every entrepreneur goes through.

But unlike the actual season, it can last much longer than three months.

Winter can show up as difficulty finding clients, low revenue, or the exhaustion from working around the clock.

It’s also those nights when you can’t sleep because your mind is buzzing with tasks you haven’t tackled.

For these reasons, entrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. It takes commitment and a lot of mental strength.

>

> •**> Research Support**> : The Kauffman Foundation reports that early entrepreneurial phases often include extended “winters” due to unstable revenue and high workload. Similarly, Harvard Business Review describes the entrepreneurial journey as a cyclical one, with inevitable phases of struggle and downturn.

## **Stay strong, joyful, and a little bit crazy**

Entrepreneurship isn’t just about hard work: it’s personal.

You’re building something that truly matters to you.

But it’s not freedom in the way people think.

You have to stay with it through the hard parts and find joy in the process.

You need resilience and sometimes even a touch of humor. And maybe just a little bit of craziness.

Sometimes, things need to get really tough before you’re motivated to make a change.

But that change can be the start of something truly fulfilling.

If you’re thinking of becoming an entrepreneur, remember: it’s more than just a career choice.

It’s a lifestyle full of ups, downs, and everything in between.

So be prepared to give it your all, to hold on tight when things get tough

…and, most importantly, to take a break now and then.
