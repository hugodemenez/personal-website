# here we go again

<Date date="2024-12-28T14:04:59.020Z" />


After so many weeks/months asking myself if it would be worth the price…

I am curently typing on a moergo glove 80 keyboard.

It is very comfortable but it is so frustrating to be slow at typing… Again (as I already made a major change by switching my keyboard layout this year.

I knew how frustrating this process could be.

But damn I had forgotten how hard it was…

I can’t directly dive into a new project right now, because I first have to remap my whole muscle memory first which is going to take 1 to 2 weeks at the very least.

I am writing this line on the 23rd of December.

After a day of use I can say it is quite pleasing but I can’t wait to be able to type as fast as before.

I can already see some improvements in my typing speed a day after using it.

I also start to see some benefits to not have to move my hands so much.

There are some keys which I don’t see in my heads and others which are already mapped from the start.

However, some keys like space and backspace are a bit confusing and most of the time I type on the wrong one.

Also, I haven’t coded yet and I doubt it would be easy too.

Three days later:

It has been 3 days now and I feel more comfortable going keystroke after keystroke.

However, I still have a lot of muscle memories going on especially with command and shift keys which are making me slow because I produce a lot of mistyping.

Also I would recommend going with a set of clicky switches.

I thought I could use [klack](https://tryklack.com)(a Mac app to reproduce key sound) but it isn’t working well enough to trick my brain) also keys are too sensitive (30gf).

Five days later:

I start to feel pain in the arm again because I haven’t setup my keyboard height properly or maybe because I am too focus on typing well and I start to feel bad when missing a keystroke.

Also, I realize I often don’t place my fingers on the keyboard the right way.

I have a lot of work to do, and see some progresses but it is hard to not be able to produce content as regular speed.

I have to be patient and to practice a lot especially using this website:[keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com)
