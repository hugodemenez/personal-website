# What should I focus on?

<Date date="2025-09-16T07:32:21.404Z" />


When people talk about FOCUS they don't emphasis enough on what to focus on.

Yes, focus is needed but there are so many things to focus on that you can quickly become overwhelmed.

So what I'd like to tell you today is: CHOOSE WHAT TO FOCUS ON.

## How to choose?

Simple.

What do you love most in your work? Creating beautifully designed stuff? Writing reliable code? Making users happy? Shipping new features?

Maybe that's the key to focus. You'll start practicing how to focus on what you love and once you'll find this focus you can practice / train this muscle.

It's then easy to jump on another task.

## My Personal Experience

So in my day to day job building Deltalytix, I often find myself lost, knowing I have many things to focus on.

So when I am completely lost, I go back to what I love. Fixing bugs and making easy to use software by creating intuitive UX (meaning it's clear how you use the app).

## The Power of Selective Attention

Focus isn't just about concentration, it's about choosing the right target.

In a world of infinite possibilities, the ability to say "no" to 99% of opportunities becomes your superpower.

Think of focus like a photographer's lens: the narrower the aperture, the sharper the subject becomes.

## Building Your Focus Muscle

Start small. Pick one thing you genuinely enjoy about your work.

Spend 25 minutes on just that. No emails, no Slack, no distractions.

Notice how it feels when you're truly absorbed. That's your focus baseline.

Gradually expand this muscle to less enjoyable but necessary tasks.

## The Focus Framework

Every morning, ask yourself: "What's the one thing that, if completed today, would make everything else easier or unnecessary?"

Write it down. Make it visible. Protect it fiercely.

Your future self will thank you for this clarity.
