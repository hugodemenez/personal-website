# Your own thoughts

<Date date="2025-11-07T15:01:22.380Z" />


I feel like we’re not steering the AI enough.

It produces a lot of content we didn’t want or mean to write in the first place, and we end up keeping it.

Sometimes, it just feels right to keep it, but in a sense, it removes the uniqueness of our words.

Words and sentences are by far the most used way of communicating today.

In the last 3 years, WWPM (words written per minute) has increased a lot for everybody using a computer (auto-completions, AI, text-to-speech).

So, how do we keep humans engaged?

I think you have to clearly show the value you provide through your writing from the very first word you write.

That isn’t a principle I have been applying for the last 2 years of writing on Substack.

I was just putting my thoughts in a note and then asking AI to fill in the missing blocks.

Now I just want to write and not even think about the end of my post, forget the beginning, and not remember what it was about.

Life is so short that maybe it’s better to enjoy it as it is. Raw.
