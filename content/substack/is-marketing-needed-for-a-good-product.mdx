# Is marketing needed for a good product?

<Date date="2025-01-04T16:40:49.234Z" />


Some people believe marketing is just fluff. Others argue it can make or break a product.

From my experience building deltalytix, an online trading journal, I’ve learned that balancing product development and marketing is tricky.

Lately, I’ve paid close attention to ads on TV in France.

Surprisingly, I’ve been impressed.

Ads used to be predictable and boring. Now, over the past six months, I’ve found myself laughing, thinking, and even feeling emotional while watching them. They’re more creative than ever.

## **A new era of creativity**

I think we’re entering a time of powerful creativity.

AI tools seem to be playing a big role. They help creators focus on ideas instead of spending too much time on technical tasks.

This shift is exciting, and it’s redefining how products are presented to people.

For a product like deltalytix, where growth is still slow, marketing feels even more critical.

## **Can marketing hurt a product?**

Marketing is necessary. Without it, no one knows your product exists.

But I can’t help wondering: can marketing backfire?

There are stories of ads that missed the mark. Some confused audiences or created backlash. Others made promises the product couldn’t deliver.

## **The balance**

A good product needs marketing. That’s clear.

But marketing can’t replace substance.

If your product is weak, flashy ads might attract attention at first, but disappointment will follow. On the other hand, even a great product might go unnoticed without good promotion.

So, the key is balance. Strong marketing should highlight the product’s real value—not cover up flaws.

## **Final thoughts**

Marketing is more than hype. Done well, it tells a story that connects with people.

But in the end, a good product and good marketing need to work together.

What do you think? Can bad marketing hurt even the best products? Or does a truly great product always shine through?
