# Getting enough

<Date date="2025-12-31T23:00:03.220Z" />


For the last 3 years I have been trading and building stuff around trading.

First through algorithmic, then discretionary and now building tools for traders.

It’s been quite a journey full of learnings and pitfalls.

With algorithms it was fun, experiments and learnings.

I first started with basic coding buy/sell at given levels through a canal.

Then building Machine Learning algorithms, learning from historical data, identifying patterns and adapting in real time, changing model weights constantly, adding new features to try to find an edge.

That was exciting but I missed all the underlyings. I took a 2 year long study path for quantitative finance and trading. It was tough but insightful.

After that I decided it was time to put effort into trading and learning through practice; discretionary trading and order book specifically.

I got into a mentorship program with a guy I looked up to and I get on well.

I knew him through his YouTube channel and discussed a few times together before going all in with him.

This made me realize that having a mentor (someone who went through the learnings before) is extremely valuable.

I got very good at trading. Earning more than 2k per month trading after 6 months of practice.

But it was intense and very exhausting. At the same time I learned that I would soon become a father.

I had really started working on trading tools to really build a sustainable business.

Thanks to the experience and insights I had about the market of trading tools I knew exactly what to build and who would be my customers.

But I didn’t know how to market, what to focus on… and really didn’t know anything about starting a business.

So again. I searched for a mentor.

It was 3 months intensive work and putting my idea out, building and learning about the market fit.

In the end, I launched and did my first $ only after 3 months building the product.

I leveraged my experience and the knowledge by providing valuable feedback and help inside trading communities, it draw the attention of moderators and admins.

I spoke with them about my product Deltalytix, they got really interested and impressed by it and offered their help marketing it!

After a full year now, it generated 15k$ in revenue and allowed me to spend quality time with my wife and newborn, as I could be away from computer while the product ran for itself without much monitoring.

However, after 2 months “away”, coming back was difficult. I had to go back on track and shipping features to keep my users interested and involved with the product.

I soon realized I wasn’t interested in trading anymore. Being away from screens made me realize it wasn’t very a thing that got me pumped about.

I wasn’t really a fan of “gambling” where the odds are not in anyone’s favor (except the ones with a edge → one I had learn about at the time of making 2k$/month with trading).

So now I focus on useful stuff. Things that can have meaningful impact and be measurable.

By building Deltalytix I encountered many issues / challenges and built softwares to solve / ease them.

Like for example, I built an entire pipeline for building newsletter emails based of weekly updates I film on my YouTube channel.

Or building reactive dashboards with AI agents integrations → turning into franchizor to help franchisees and franchisors manage their franchise networks.

I am more than ever executed about what coming with software development in the coming days!

That’s my last post of 2025! See you in 2026✨
