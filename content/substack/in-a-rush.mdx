# In a rush

<Date date="2025-06-28T18:18:39.951Z" />


Sometimes life feels like a fast-moving river.

You try to keep up. You want to move forward, but your energy just isn’t there.

That mix of urgency and exhaustion is familiar to many of us. It’s confusing and frustrating.

You want to do your best, but your body and mind push back.

How do you handle that?

# **Phases of flow**

Growing up, I noticed that life comes in phases.

Some weeks, everything clicks, you feel unstoppable and work flows easily.

Other times, you feel grumpy or off, you don’t want to push yourself, and that’s okay.

Then there are the hardest moments, when you have to keep going but feel drained inside.

Each phase has its own mood and challenge.

None lasts forever.

# **Listening to yourself**

The key is to listen.

When you feel grumpy, don’t fight it. You can’t just snap out of it.

Accept it as a phase and let it pass.

When you feel exhausted, it’s different.

Now, technology helps us track our health easily. Watches, scales, apps they show us data about sleep, heart rate, stress.

This information can tell you when your body really needs rest and you must listen.

There’s no shortcut here. Ignoring exhaustion only makes things worse.

Taking a break is not weakness. It’s smart.

# **Taking care of one life**

You only get one life.

It’s easy to forget that when you’re caught up in deadlines and demands.

But your health matters more than any task.

Sometimes, you have to slow down.

Take a day off, rest enough and eat something nourishing.

I’m in that phase right now, I have a lot to do, but I feel tired.

I know it’s temporary, so I try to nap when I can, keep good sleep, and eat well.

It’s not always perfect, but I’m trying.

Life isn’t just about rushing. It’s about living well.

# **It’s hard but worth it**

Handling these phases can be tough, when you feel exhausted but must push, it feels unfair, when you want to do more, but your body resists.

It’s frustrating and lonely at times but it’s part of life’s rhythm.

You will pass through this and when you come out the other side, it will be worth it.

Remember to be kind to yourself.

You are doing your best.

Take care, guys.
