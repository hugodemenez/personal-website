# We can’t handle everything.

<Date date="2025-05-10T13:33:35.392Z" />


*On November 30th I made a draft about this post. I have added comments 8 months later - now (everything in italic)*

This could be in life or work, sometimes we have to let things go.

For the past three months, I have been juggling three main activities:

- Trading

- Developing a SaaS around trading

- Building a startup in cybersecurity

The latter is time-consuming and unrelated to the others but extremely close to my heart ♥︎.

However, I realized I can’t go further with all this mess in my head.

So, either I find a reliable solution, e.g., raise money (to start delegating), pause, or kill the project right away. **note:*In the end I decided to kill the cybersecurity project***

I am on a path to raising funds in order to hire one backend developer (I already know the top dev in the field), and the best marketing guy (I also know who), in order to build an incredible product. **note:*This could have been the start of the end…***

Sharing here is a way for me to acknowledge the fact that I can't do everything.

# Now, 8 months after writing the first part

So yeah, 8 months later I am proud of the choices I made along the way. I decided to kill this cybersecurity project.

There is now a plethora of cybersecurity startups doing the thing I had in mind and I realize I wasn’t driven by this project at all.

My co-founder and I were both desperate and trying to find a way out.

This isn’t the best leitmotif. You shouldn’t build a startup to find a way out.

I think the best way to build a startup is to be driven by something.

Today, I am driven by statistics and journaling for trading.

My motivation is clear:

>

> Provide a tool for traders to track their progress and reflect on their data to become profitable and consistent.

I am a trader myself; at least, I consider myself a trader. For 14 months now, I have been trading daily, getting $6,500 out of trading accounts from prop firms in which I have invested $2,500 (trading tools included).

So yeah… I am not a billionaire yet. But I have acquired a lot of knowledge regarding trading (technical analysis, psychological factors, and fundamentals (yield curves, options pricing).

Along the way, I have also built a project I am proud of, and I can almost live from it (500$ MRR currently - which is not a lot, but I am working on it to make it the best product on the market, thanks to my experience and my own needs).

I have learned a lot in the past year, more than I ever did. I have experienced deep downs and high ups. Life is a roller coaster for sure, and that’s so fu*king exciting.

Go live this fully, learn from every downs and enjoy every ups!
