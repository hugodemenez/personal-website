# Dreams vs ambitions

<Date date="2025-09-29T14:03:50.779Z" />


I got this idea while running through a wide-open prairie, the tall grasses whispering against my legs under a vast blue sky. My sneakers kicked up bits of earth, and in my head, I kept repeating, “I’m going to reach my dreams.”

It felt motivating at first, like fuel for pushing through the endless horizon.

But as the wind picked up, carrying the scent of wildflowers, something clicked.

Was I really chasing dreams, or was I finally admitting to my ambitions?

**What dreams really are**

Dreams pop up when you’re asleep, right?

Those wild stories your brain spins while you’re out cold – flying over rooftops or talking to long-lost friends.

They’re fuzzy, fleeting, and gone by morning coffee.

I’ve had ones where I’m back in my childhood home, the wooden floors creaking under my feet, but they vanish like mist when I wake up.

The trouble starts when we borrow that word for our waking lives. It’s like slapping a “not real” label on something important.

Why do we do that? Maybe it’s comfy, a way to keep expectations low. But it tricks you into thinking those hopes are just bedtime tales, not things you can actually chase.

**When I mixed them up**

Picture this: I’m at a casual dinner with friends, plates of cheese and baguette scattered on the table.

Someone asks, “What’s your goal in life?” I blurt out, “My dream is to get a lot of money, enjoy life, and build a company to create stuff.” It sounded good to me. But inside, I knew I was dodging the real question.

See, goals and ambitions aren’t the same, and neither are dreams.

Goals are those quick wins, like finishing a project by Friday or hitting the gym three times a week. They’re steps, measurable and done.

Ambitions? They’re deeper, the fire that drives you long-term. They’re what you build your days around, the ones that make your heart race when you imagine them coming true.

I lumped my ambitions into the dream category because it felt safer. “Oh, it’s just a dream,” I’d say, like that excused me from trying.

For years, I’d talk about launching a company in the home appliance industry—designing products that last a lifetime, winning something prestigious like a Red Dot Design award, and growing it into a global brand known for durability.

But calling it a “dream” kept it vague, like a distant fantasy I could admire without the risk of failure.

**The trick your brain plays**

Ever notice how words shape your actions?

Calling something a dream is like whispering to your brain, “This won’t happen, so relax.” It’s sneaky. Suddenly, that ambition to start a small business or learn a new skill feels optional, like a nice idea for a rainy day.

I did this for so long – talking about my “dream” of building a company that ships reliable appliances worldwide, from energy-efficient refrigerators to tough blenders that families rely on for generations. But I never sketched prototypes, researched supply chains, or even outlined a business plan. It stayed in the ether.

Ambitions demand more. They’re solid, like the weight of a well-worn backpack on your shoulders as you hike a familiar trail. You feel them pulling you forward.

When I started swapping “dream” for “ambition,” things shifted.

Now, my ambition is clear: create a home appliance company from the ground up, earn that Red Dot recognition for innovative, built-to-last designs, scale it to serve customers across the world, and one day retire knowing it’s thriving—ready to hand over to my children or even grandchildren.

It’s no longer fuzzy; I’ve got notes on sustainable materials, market research on global demand, and a timeline for my first prototype. Real progress, even if it’s messy.

**What if we all stopped hiding behind dreams?**

Imagine admitting your ambitions out loud, without the escape hatch. It might just make them feel closer, more touchable.

For me, owning this vision of a legacy business—appliances that endure like heirlooms—has me reaching out to designers and studying award-winning products.

It’s intimidating, but it’s real.

**Owning your ambitions**

Lately, I’ve been practicing.

Instead of dreamy what-ifs, I list ambitions plainly: build that appliance company step by step, target the Red Dot Design award with a standout prototype, ensure every product screams durability for worldwide markets, and plan for a handover that lets me step back fulfilled. No fluff.

It’s scary, yeah – what if the prototypes flop or the market shifts? But it’s honest.

Ambitions aren’t guarantees; they’re invitations to show up.

Think about your own life. That thing you’ve called a dream for years – is it really just an ambition waiting for the right name? Give it a try. Say it out loud. Feel the difference. It’s like stepping out of a soft fog into crisp morning air, ready to move.

In the end, dreams fade with the dawn, but ambitions? They stick around, urging you on.

I’ve got mine in sight now: a company that builds lasting value, from innovative designs to a family legacy and honestly, it feels good to stop pretending they’re not real.

What’s one ambition you’re ready to claim today?
