# No need to speak, just do.

<Date date="2025-02-12T16:19:34.607Z" />


Lately I have been extremely inspired by entrepreneurs from north of France.

I have already spoken about the roots of entrepreneurship and my close relationship with it. Relating to things like that is a motivational boost and pushes me to innovate and create a physical product.

## My Journey into Dry-Aged Meat

I told you about my project some time ago but here it is again:

During my engineering studies I started to eat more and more meat. I think I was in need of proteins.

Thus I visited my butcher almost once every week.

He had a marvelous dry-aged meat closet, so I tried dry-aged meat for the first time in 2021.

I can guarantee it tastes much better than regular meat.

Meat you buy in mass markets is average and most of the time below average. The cow is slaughtered before 4 years old and directly consumed.

Dry-aged meat you buy at the butcher store is much different.

If you have a good butcher, the meat comes from cows which have been raised in good conditions and much longer than 4 years.

Then the meat is stored in a dry-aging cabinet for 60 to 120 days.

During this process a cover is created on the outside of the piece of meat (it is most of the time a big part of the ribs, which you can then cut to get "cote a l'os"), it is recommended that this dried part is mostly fat. Then on the inside, we have the meat and fibers. During the dry-aging process the meat is tenderized thanks to enzymes breaking fibers.

This dry-aging and great raising conditions for the cow come at a quite expensive cost.

But it tastes so good, you have to try it. And maybe you could stop eating meat 3-4 times a week but instead, just once or twice a month.

## The Vision: Accessible Dry-Aging for All

My goal is to allow anyone to dry-age their own meat.

First, it is going to reduce the cost for the butcher (he won’t have to dry-age himself, and store the meat).

Second, you could control the degree of dry-aging. I like 60 days of dry-aging, but sometimes I like 90 or even 120.

Third, you get it. If you reduce the cost for the butcher, in the long run, it is going to reduce the cost for you too.

## Prototype Development and Future Aspirations

In 2022, I started working on a prototype and thinking about engineering "hacks" to improve and replace the existing cabinets which currently exist.

The well-known industrial product is known as Dry Ager. Their products are great but too expensive for households.

However, recently, I had to stop thinking about this in order to focus on my entrepreneurial journey in cybersecurity, now in software for financial institutions.

My goal is to create a successful company which could fund my endeavors in industrial design.

This is my motivation, my goal.

But as it grows, I am more and more eager to start this endeavor.

## Wisdom from a Renowned Entrepreneur

>

> No need to speak about what you’ll do. Just do it. Once you do, you are going to be copied (if you’re good enough).

> Diffusion is much broader when a business is good. It’s much better for a business to work well because it is being copied rather than working because we spoke about it.

> When we are the best, we are copied.

if you remove the first rungs of a ladder, you can’t reach the top.
