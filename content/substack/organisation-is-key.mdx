# Organisation is key

<Date date="2024-12-08T18:59:46.204Z" />


Last week, I started writing about what was on my mind.

I felt overwhelmed and unfocused because of the many different activities I was juggling.

I said yes to everything coming my way, thinking it would lead to something great.

However, I realized it was time for a change.

Time to fully focus on one thing (one field, in my case).

In life, I think it is so much easier to say yes than to say no.

Society often makes people believe that saying yes is the best thing to do because it opens up opportunities.

And yes, it does.

However, once you’ve found the right opportunity, you need to fully focus on it.

So, from now on, I am fully focusing. I’m starting to remove the noise. We’ll see how it goes.

I’ll make sure to keep you updated.
