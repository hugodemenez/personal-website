# The strange rhythm of exhaustion

<Date date="2025-01-25T08:48:16.913Z" />


Past weeks were energizing.

Each day was full of purpose, ideas, and growth.

But now, writing this at the start of the week, I feel drained. Completely spent.

This feeling isn’t new to me.

Most of the time, I can sense it coming. I know when I’m at the top of the hill, where everything feels easy, and the downhill slide is just ahead.

Last week was different.

Everything was going so well in my entrepreneurial journey that I didn’t notice. I had already started falling.

This week was tough.

## **The numbers can be deceiving**

Since the year began, there has been growth.

Every day, ten new users joined the platform.

Ten new people discovering what I’ve created.

But there’s a catch. They weren’t paying customers.

Even after sending personalized emails to every new user ([see my previous post on customer care](https://hugodemenez.substack.com/p/customer-support-and-getting-traction?r=stapf)), I wasn’t getting the feedback I needed.

So, I dug deeper.

## **Understanding the real problem**

The issue wasn’t with my effort. It was with my product.

The free version wasn’t compelling enough.

Even worse, it wasn’t aimed at the right audience.

My first marketing move had been good for one thing: visibility.

It introduced me to the vast, broad world of trading.

But it didn’t speak directly to the people I needed: futures traders.

This realization hit me hard.

## **Pivoting towards clarity**

So now, I’m planning my next marketing move.

This isn’t something I can rush.

For months, I’ve been preparing in the background. Every detail matters.

But it’s not just marketing. This week, I’ve been focused on creating something new.

*A sharing feature.*

It’s designed for retail traders.

They are the people who naturally market the product by showing off their performance.

They need a tool that lets them share up-to-date reports with their community: quickly, simply.

But even with this, there’s another challenge.

## **Keeping the edge**

Some users don’t convert to paid customers.

It’s frustrating, but I know why.

There’s a missing feature, something my largest competitor has.

My product still has an edge. Speed. Optimization.

But with recent updates, I’ve started losing that edge.

This weekend, I know what I need to do.

I’ll focus on sharpening what’s already in my users’ hands.

Because if I don’t, my product risks becoming ordinary.

## **What exhaustion reveals**

Sometimes, exhaustion isn’t a signal to stop.

It’s a signal to pause. To think.

This week, I’ve learned to listen to it. To understand what needs to change.

This is just another part of the process.

A moment to reflect before climbing the next hill.
