# Learning is fundamental

<Date date="2024-12-29T11:11:16.665Z" />


Do you really think Einstein stopped learning once he established the special theory of relativity?

To me, it is clear that we have to keep learning new things to grow as human beings.

Reflecting on this thought, I realized we have to be accountable for what we learn in order to progress.

This year, I think I learned more than in any other year, and it made me wonder: should we aim to learn more every new year than the year before?

It could be a great goal, but is it worth pursuing?

Here is what I might have learned this year:

>

> • I should not dive into too many different activities, or it could cost me, because quitting something is much harder than starting something.

> • Reading things I love motivates me (biographies of entrepreneurs and inventors are what I love the most).

> • Failing at things (or at least not succeeding) is what brings the most learning.

> • Kindness doesn’t pay, but I can feel proud of what I do to help others. (I should choose more wisely who to give my time to.)

> • You can achieve anything you want (this one is for everybody). Only your beliefs limit your achievements. I’m sure we can do great things.

> • Act upon your dreams, don’t feel grumpy when you shouldn’t, and think about your goals.

**Goals?** There is nothing worth pursuing if you don’t think it is achievable. You have to be sure about **achievability** in order to make a goal worth it.

I learned many things in frontend development, design, and backend infrastructure (but still have things to try out, like orchestration, load balancers, Redis, and more logging tools).

You don’t have to know everything to build great stuff. Most software is not much more advanced than its MVP phase, if you really think about it, because keeping things simple is also an indicator of success.

I mean, if you can build successful, simple things, that’s great. →** Warning here**: Even if Dyson motors aren’t that hard or complex, they took many years to engineer. We can also think about the **over-simplification** of Raptor engines in SpaceX rockets.
