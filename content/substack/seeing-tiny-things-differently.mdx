# Seeing tiny* things differently

<Date date="2024-11-13T07:16:42.136Z" />


Recently, I made the choice to share my journey on LinkedIn.

I decided to open up and be transparent, sharing everything that crosses my mind, honestly and with the beliefs I hold.

But why now and not before?

I think I’ve reached a point where I feel proud of my journey.

I find myself wanting others to understand who I am, and what I’m building. The desire to be seen, to be known, has become stronger than before.

For the past year, I’ve been quietly building in the background. But I haven’t spoken much about it.

I realize now that I don’t really have any tangible “track” of what I’ve done. It almost feels as if I’ve done nothing.

That’s a strange realization, isn’t it? Without results, how can you truly measure what you’ve achieved?

People around me kept saying, “It’s important to share your work.” But I never fully understood why.

Sharing seems like a simple thing to do, yet it’s in the tiny details that everything matters.

At first, I tried using tools like ChatGPT to refine my thoughts, make my posts more engaging. I wanted my message to hit home.

But the result? It didn’t feel personal.

The posts felt almost empty, like something was missing.

Then, it clicked. It’s in the tiny details. It’s the subtle things that our brains unconsciously identify as authentic.

I believe that’s why AI won’t replace us anytime soon.

Yes, AI can do incredible things, even create impressive works.

But creativity (true creativity) is something humans bring into the world.

Even if AI is capable of surpassing us in many ways, it’s still us, as humans, who spark authenticity.

Humans can relate to other humans.

We react to our environments, to our experiences, and express that through our creativity.

And even if AI becomes more advanced, even surpasses us in certain areas, the question remains: is that dangerous? Is it problematic?

Or is this just part of life?

You can create something that challenges you, something that might even push you to your limits.

And then, we drift into the philosophical: What is the purpose of life?

If death didn’t exist, would life still hold meaning?

These are the tiny things that shape how we see the world.

It’s the small, intricate pieces that make the difference.

Perhaps, it’s only by embracing these details, and understanding their value, that we truly understand what we’re building, both as individuals and as creators.

In the end, the journey is made up of these moments.

Small yet significant.
