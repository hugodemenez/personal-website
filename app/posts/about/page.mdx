I have been driven by programming and investing.

## My Journey

### How it started

Building [trading algorithms](/posts/trading-algorithms) is a trend many junior developers have followed.

> Who wouldn't dream about earning money in the market anytime of the day.

This path taught me a lot about APIs, algorithms and optimization. It drove me to learn about quantitative finance and machine learning.

Soon I began developing a [seasonal strategy](/posts/seasonal-strategy)
rooted in fundamental company analysis. I used `LLMs` to quickly analyze thousands of 10Ks and filter companies suited for the strategy.

### Discretionary trading

Without experience in discretionary trading, no one would ever build a sustainable strategy.
You have to understand the basics of macro-economy, market manipulations and orderbook analysis.

So in 2023, I started learning about discretionary trading and practicing everyday.
For the past <YearFromNow year={2023} /> years, I've been focused on discretionary trading strategies for US stocks,
leveraging volume profile and orderbook analysis.

I find quantitative trading and machine learning to be fascinating fields that continue to inspire and drive my innovation.

### My Passion for Open Source and Knowledge Sharing

I'm deeply committed to open source and the free exchange of knowledge.
Contributing to the community is one of my core values.

### My first startup

This passion led me to create [App-Prove](https://app-prove.com),
a cybersecurity startup aimed at making the audit process more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly for everyone.

This experience taught me a lot about entrepreneurship, product development and user experience.
But also the difficulties of building a startup. Project ended after 8 months of work.
Many other startups focusing on the same pain point were launching at the same time and I had to recognize my lack of experience.

### When it clicks

Realizing that I could build a startup in a domain I had some knowleddge about, I started to build [Deltalytix](https://deltalytix.app),
a tool for traders to track their performance and quantitative tools.

Now I'm using my academic knowledge to create tools that help traders make better decisions.

## Current Projects
