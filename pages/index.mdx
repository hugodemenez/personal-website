## Programming

For the past <span>{new Date().getFullYear() - 2018}</span> years,
I have been driven by programming and investing.

## Sharing my thoughts

Every week, I share my thoughts on [Substack](https://substack.com/@hugodemenez).
Here you can find some of my posts:

## Interviews

I've been fortunate to share my journey and insights in various interviews:

<YouTube code="K2QuAwVl1oI" title="Interview about my trading journey and strategies" />

<YouTube code="zC-7tx3ar0w" title="Discussion about quantitative trading and machine learning" />

<YouTube code="CeWglVNpevk" title="My testimony after 1 year of trading" />

### How it started

Building [trading algorithms](/posts/trading-algorithms) is a trend many junior developers have followed.
> Who wouldn't dream about earning money in the market anytime of the day.

This path taught me a lot about APIs, algorithms and optimization. It drove me to learn about quantitative finance and machine learning.

Soon I began developing a [seasonal strategy](/posts/seasonal-strategy)
rooted in fundamental company analysis. I used `LLMs` to quickly analyze thousands of 10Ks and filter companies suited for the strategy.

### Discretionary trading

Without experience in discretionary trading, no one would ever build a sustainable strategy.
You have to understand the basics of macro-economy, market manipulations and orderbook analysis.

So in 2023, I started learning about discretionary trading and practicing everyday.
For the past <span>{new Date().getFullYear() - 2023}</span> years, I've been focused on discretionary trading strategies for US stocks,
leveraging volume profile and orderbook analysis.

I find quantitative trading and machine learning to be fascinating fields that continue to inspire and drive my innovation.

### My Passion for Open Source and Knowledge Sharing

I'm deeply committed to open source and the free exchange of knowledge.
Contributing to the community is one of my core values.


### My first startup

This passion led me to create [App-Prove](https://app-prove.com),
a cybersecurity startup aimed at making the audit process more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly for everyone.

This experience taught me a lot about entrepreneurship, product development and user experience.
But also the difficulties of building a startup. Project ended after 8 months of work. 
Many other startups focusing on the same pain point were launching at the same time and I had to recognize my lack of experience.

### When it clicks

Realizing that I could build a startup in a domain I had some knowleddge about, I started to build [Deltalytix](https://deltalytix.app),
a tool for traders to track their performance and quantitative tools.

Now I'm using my academic knowledge to create tools that help traders make better decisions.

## Current Projects 

### Trading and Investing

* [Deltalytix](https://deltalytix.app): Empowering traders with performance tracking and quantitative tools
* [SteinPrograms](https://steinprograms.com): Developing quantitative automated trading strategies and a cutting-edge news API

## Technical Expertise

### `Python` for Machine Learning and Data Analysis

* Machine Learning (Regression, decision trees, and classification)
* API development (using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com))
* Large Language Models (Prompt templating, `langchain`)

### `TypeScript` for Web Development

* `NextJS`
* `TailwindCSS`
* `Shadcn`
* `Lucid`
* `Vercel`
* `Supabase`

### Continuous Learning

I'm always eager to expand my skills. Currently, I'm exploring:

* `Rust`: For fast and secure code development
* `Michelson`: To build smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain
