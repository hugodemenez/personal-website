## Current projects 

### Industrial product journey

* ðŸš€ 3D Modeling a reactive dry aging appliance and filing patent for an incredible dry-aging process

> Dive into budget-friendly gourmet at home with the help of machine learning and computer vision. Enjoy the extraordinary flavors of dry-aged meat, cheese, wine, and sausagesâ€”all effortlessly tailored by the appliance.

### Finance and investing project
* ðŸ“Š Developping a mathematical analysis method to predict market trends with machine learning tools

> I'm using my studies to create tools that make investing safer and more profitable. These tools automatically adjust strategies based on market sentiment, providing a reliable way to navigate and succeed in the ever-changing market landscape.
