## Programming

For the past <span>{new Date().getFullYear() - 2018}</span> years,
I have been driven by programming and investing.

When I turned 18 and could open a trading account, it quickly became a passion.

Then programming became a new quest. At school it was a mistery. Lines I couldn't understand.

But when I realized I could automate stuff I quickly thought about automating my investments.

However, no broker at the time had reliable APIs. So I turned to crypto platforms.

That's how I learned programming: into building [trading algorithms](/posts/trading-algorithms)
for cryptocurrency trading.  

My journey began with developing a [seasonal strategy](/posts/seasonal-strategy)
rooted in fundamental company analysis which was learned through my quantitative finance master.
 
And now, I'm focused on discretionary trading strategies for US stocks, leveraging volume profile and orderbook analysis.

I find quantitative trading and machine learning to be fascinating fields that continue to inspire and drive my innovation.

### My Passion for Open Source and Knowledge Sharing

I'm deeply committed to open source and the free exchange of knowledge. Contributing to the community is one of my core values. This passion led me to create [App-Prove](https://app-prove.com), a cybersecurity startup aimed at making the audit process more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly for everyone.
