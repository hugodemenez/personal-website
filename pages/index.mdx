## Who am I?

Hey there! 

A deep fascination drives my engagement with computer programs.
This exploration serves as a gateway to understanding the intricate workings of the world, particularly in the context of the stock market.
The experience feels akin to unraveling puzzles and continually gaining insights into new facets of knowledge!

As my passion evolved, I found myself immersed in the exhilarating realm of envisioning and crafting tangible products within my personal workshop. The quest? To bring forth extraordinary innovations that redefine accessibility in the industrial landscape, making industrial beauty more attainable.

Fueled by this enthusiasm, I seamlessly fuse my love for technology with the artistry of industrial design. The result? A one-of-a-kind machine designed to elevate the flavor of meat through a mesmerizing aging process, promising a culinary experience like no other.

## Main activities
 
### Industrial product journey
* ðŸš€ 3D Modeling a reactive dry aging appliance and filing patent for an incredible dry-aging process
