## Who am I ?

Hey there! 

I'm an avid fan of both computers and the internet. 
One of my favorite things to do is tinker around with computer programs to help me better understand how the world works, especially when it comes to the stock market.
It's like solving puzzles and constantly learning new things!

With enthusiasm, I blend my love for technology with industrial design, creating a unique machine that amplifies meat's flavor through a captivating aging process.

* Machine Learning (Regression, decision tree and classification)

### Learning

* `Rust` to build blazingly fast softwares
* `Solidity` conceiving automated contracts

### Enjoying 

* coding in good vanilla `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`
