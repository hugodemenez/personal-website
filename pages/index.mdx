## Who am I?

Hey there! 

I'm captivated by the world of computer programsâ€”it's like solving puzzles and uncovering new knowledge, especially in the mysterious realm of the stock market.

Now, my focus has shifted to a secret workshop where I'm crafting extraordinary and affordable innovations. Picture a fusion of technology and design, culminating in a mysterious machine. Its mission? To transform the taste of meat through an enchanting aging process, promising a culinary adventure like no other.

## Main activities
 
### Industrial product journey
* ðŸš€ 3D Modeling a reactive dry aging appliance and filing patent for an incredible dry-aging process

> Dive into budget-friendly gourmet at home with the help of machine learning and computer vision. Enjoy the extraordinary flavors of dry-aged meat, cheese, wine, and sausagesâ€”all effortlessly tailored by the appliance.

### Finance and investing project
* ðŸ“Š Developping a mathematical analysis method to predict market trends with machine learning tools

> I'm using my studies to create tools that make investing safer and more profitable. These tools automatically adjust strategies based on market sentiment, providing a reliable way to navigate and succeed in the ever-changing market landscape.

## My coding experience

### Extensive use of `python` 

* Machine Learning (Regression, decision tree and classification)
* API (using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com),
* Large Language Model (Prompt templating, `langchain`)
* Data Analytics

### Learning things

* `Rust` to build blazingly fast softwares
* `Solidity` conceiving automated contracts

### Enjoying other stuff

* coding in good vanilla `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` 
* JavaScript frameworks like NextJS and Astro
