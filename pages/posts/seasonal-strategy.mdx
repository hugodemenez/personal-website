Warning: This is not a financial advice. This is just my personal strategy that I use to make a decent return on the stock market.

# Seasonal strategy

Seeing the market going up and down like a seesaw is very frustrating.
I have been thinking about a strategy to exploit this movement.

## The idea

The idea is to buy the undervalued assets using the seasonality of the market.
Just by looking at seasonality, you can see that the market is going up and down at different times of the year.

You can use this movement to make money.

## The strategy

The strategy is very simple.
I find a company which has a seasonlity in its stock price.
I read news about a company, evaluate the financial state of the company, the industry, the country, the world...

And if the company has a stable financial state, I buy the stock at the lowest point of the seasonality and sell it at the average point.
