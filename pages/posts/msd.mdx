The follThe following is a discussion on the implications of new technologies in the field of technology and their impact on the current understanding of software engineering. In this exploration, I aim to share my insights and initiate a dialogue with you in the comments section.

## What are we talking about

Modern Software Development (MSD) involves using new technologies like server-side components (for web development), load balancers (for APIs), and containerization, for instance.

The explanation above is a bit unclear, but I want to share my thoughts because I've noticed many beginners in software development using these technologies in the wrong way.

## Using the right tool

In fact, you might find some people using React for non-reactive websites. Indeed, the use-case of the technology is for large websites and especially web applications like Facebook (which developed React for their specific use case).

I find it quite useful to remind people that sometimes, you shouldn't use the latest tool to build your projects. For example, you could spend some time writing simple HTML to achieve a better result

<Image

  alt="Chef unable to choose the right knife"
  width={1125}
  height={750}

  className="next-image"
/>

# New technologies for the better

Lately, there's been a buzz about a new technology called HTMX. After trying it out and observing others using it, I must say it's quite impressive. One of the standout features is its ability to update traditional HTML websites, turning them into more interactive and responsive ones.

If you are into web development, you should give it a try! With just one line of code you have access to loads of features! Take a look at the doc and examples on their website : [HTMX Documentation](https://htmx.org/docs/)

Next week, Iâ€™ll write only once but focus on a technical post about web technologies and how to create a website easily. Stay tuned! You might find it interesting.

Enjoy your week end!
