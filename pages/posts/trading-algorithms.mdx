# Trading algorithms

Building a trading algorithm is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the market
I have been programming trading algorithms for several years now.
I have tested many strategies and I want to share my experience with you.

## What is a trading algorithm?

A trading algorithm is a set of instructions that a computer follows to make trading decisions.
It is used to buy and sell assets in the market automatically.

## What can a trading algorithm do?

A trading algorithm can do many things. 
It can be used to
- scalp cryptocurrencies,
- arbitrage between different markets,
- trend follow,
- mean reverting,
- event driven trading,
- etc.

## What do you need to build a trading algorithm?

To build a trading algorithm, you need to have a deep understanding of the market and the tools used to trade.
You need to have a good understanding of the programming language you are using.
You need to have a good understanding of the trading strategy you are implementing.

## What are the steps to build a trading algorithm?

1. Define the trading strategy :
    * Choose the asset you want to trade
    * Choose the time frame you want to trade
    * Choose the trading strategy you want to use
2. Implement the trading strategy :
    * Choose the programming language you want to use
    * Choose the tools you want to use
3. Test the trading strategy (Backtesting)
4. Optimize the trading strategy
5. Deploy the trading strategy

## What are the tools I use?

I use `python` for the trading algorithms.
I know people use `ccxt` to get the price of the asset but I prefer to code my own REST API.
I use `pandas` to manage the data.
I use `numpy` to do the math.
I use `sklearn` to do the machine learning.

## What are the challenges?

The main challenge is to find a strategy that works.
You need a strong architecture to manage everything and a good backtesting system.
It is a long process of trial and error.
