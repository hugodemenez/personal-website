There are a few things I recently learned that I'd like to share with you.

- Git commits enhanced -> To collaborate efficiently
- Markdown new styling for relevent messages

# Commits enhancements

Let's start with something I really wanted to write about.
It is a way for me to remember.

Commits should have the following structure :
```md
TYPE(SCOPE) : Short title

Details about things changed with the commit
```
 
There are different types:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies 
* **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts 
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

Reference: [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Then, about the scope :
It is a short word to define what are changes affecting

## Breaking changes

If you add a `!` after the scope, it means the commit is a breaking change.
A breaking change is an API response change for example.
