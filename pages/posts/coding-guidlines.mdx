There are a few things I recently learned that I'd like to share with you.

- Git commits enhanced -> To look super organized
- Markdown new styling for relevent messages


# Commits enhancements

Let's start with something I really wanted to write about in order to have a place where I can remember it

Now I'll write my commits this way :

```md
TYPE(SCOPE) : Short title

Details about things changed with the commit
```
 
First, let's take a look at different types accepted :
* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

Then, about the scope :
> It is a short word to define what are changes affecting
