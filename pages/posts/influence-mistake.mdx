In the following, I'll talk about my recent mistake in forcing myself to change my coding habits.

# How it started
3 months ago,
As I was starting the "Entrepreneurial" journey (mostly being jobless and trying to find out how to make money),
I decided to switch to NeoVim.
I discovered NeoVim a few years ago and thought it was more pain than good.
But I decided to give it a try because of all the hype I was getting from youtube recommendation.

The benefits of using NeoVim were quite obvious to me :
* No fancy install of a software (could be used in terminal)
* Could work on a VPS (easily change hardware)
* More control over IDE

SO I switched...

It was really hard and I was forcing myself to do so...
I kept telling me that if I managed to overcome this challange, then I could do anything related to my projects.

And I pushed forward, struggling and not coding a lot for 3 months.
It was extremely painful emotionally, seeing no progress and just being in front of the computer knowing that it was hard.

At some points, I installed VSCode and coded a little bit. At first it was just making shame on me.
But after sometime, I realized I was missing tmux and coding in the terminal.

That's how I started hating VSCode. But I wasn't producing anything compelling on project side.

I think VSCode is really good at allowing developers to produce code, and "Working things".

By taking a little step back, I realized that people making awesome things don't care a lot about the tool they use.
They just know what they want to build and use anything they have at hand reach.

People who truly dedicate to something because they think it will allow them to do awesome things are just finding excuses to not try to build
with tools they already have.

> Don't spend hours thinking about the tool to use, instead put those hours into work!
