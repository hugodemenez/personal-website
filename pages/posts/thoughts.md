# Modern Software Development

## What is modern software development?  
Modern development refers to the latest practices, tools, and technologies used in building software applications. It encompasses a wide range of
topics, from coding best practices and methodologies to the use of modern frameworks and libraries.

In terms of web development, modern development often involves using frameworks like ReactJS, Angular, and VueJS. These frameworks can help
developers build complex applications more quickly and efficiently by providing pre-built components and tools. However, they also require a
certain level of technical knowledge to use effectively.

For instance, instead of using `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript` mordern developers use `ReactJS`[^1].

### Footnotes

[^1]: ReactJS is most of the time called React, however, people don't realize they don't have the same purpose.
