The following article discusses the different seeds that shaped the entrepreneurial mindset of a generation. Through the lens of personal insights, we'll explore how entrepreneurship has become more popular again and entered a new phase. Join me as we uncover the interesting reasons behind this change.

## From generation to generation

My grand father has been and continues to be someone I look up to. As he led a moving company for many years, he made a profound change in my vision of the world and business. In fact, he might also be the first who introduced me to computers… As I started writing things on what might have been Microsoft WORD on windows 95.

*I recall the crimson car nestled in my grandfather's warehouse, a place where I often spent my time playing.*

As an entrepreneur he had to handle quite a lot of things, accountability, customers management, and providing his moving services. That’s how I realized that managing a company was possible no matter the size.

Today he stills give me advices about going one step at a time and trying things out. This advice is not just good; it is akin to the architectural marvel of constructing greatness, one step at a time.

## No Excuses, just achievements

Here in France, we have some incredible stories of family businesses and successes. Indeed, the story of Bernard Arnault from the LVMH group always resonated in me. He was raised in my city and this made me think that I couldn't find excuses about the place. Bernard Arnault is the richest man of Europe and [the second richest man of the world](https://www.forbes.com/profile/bernard-arnault/?sh=562f56d066fa) as when I am writing this in late 2023.

He managed to scale his businesses and grew his empire worldwide. He went to Polytechnique Paris which crafts the brightest minds of the world. About engineering schools, I’d like to say that it might not be because of magical knowledges you get but more in the mindset you get there that leads you to success. Let me explain a little bit more about that.

# The true essence of scholarships

Regarding my education, I attended a reputable engineering school in northern France, pursued studies at a French university, and even explored an internationally renowned institution like Harvard.

Frankly, I don't believe my knowledge surpasses that of someone without the same educational background. In today's world, books and the internet provide unparalleled opportunities to delve deeper into any subject.

> Therefore, the primary value these schools offer is confidence - confidence in the ability to learn anything, confidence in achieving the seemingly impossible, and confidence in leading a group.

## A reviving trend
Nowadays, through social media we get surrounded by success stories of young entrepreneurs. It’s extremely overwhelming and might sometimes sounds too much. It is not a new trend. In fact, I have learned that the entrepreneurial era might have started in the 18s on the Industrial Revolution.

Indeed, the more tools we have to build, the more people want to try getting those tools to be practical. That's why it was also the case in the 90s, during the internet bubble.

And once again, this holds true today with Artificial Intelligence, especially with powerful tools like Large Language Models. They unlock a world of possibilities.

That's why I firmly believe the perfect moment to innovate and embark on the entrepreneurship journey is now. Today, in our hands, we hold a powerful new tool, making this moment exceptionally opportune and filled with boundless potential.

So… Why not give it a try?
