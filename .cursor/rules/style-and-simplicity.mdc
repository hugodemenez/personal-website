# Style and Simplicity Guidelines

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever ones
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid adding packages unless absolutely necessary
- **Clean Code**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain
- **Consistent Styling**: Maintain the creamy theme aesthetic throughout

## Code Style

### TypeScript
- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use `Readonly<>` for props when appropriate
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use functional components with hooks
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Prefer composition over complex prop drilling
- Use `'use client'` only when necessary (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively
- Leverage theme variables from `globals.css`:
  - `text-foreground`, `text-muted` for text colors
  - `bg-background`, `bg-surface` for backgrounds
  - `text-accent`, `text-accent-light` for accent colors
  - `border-border` for borders
- Prefer semantic color names over raw hex values
- Use `transition-colors` for hover states
- Keep spacing consistent (use Tailwind spacing scale)

### File Organization
- Components in `components/` directory
- Pages in `app/` directory following Next.js App Router conventions
- MDX content in `app/` or `content/` directories
- Keep related files close together

## Design Patterns

### Navigation
- Use Next.js `Link` component for internal navigation
- External links should include `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Navigation should be accessible and keyboard-friendly

### Animations
- Use View Transitions for page transitions (already configured)
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful
- Prefer CSS transitions over JavaScript animations when possible

### MDX Content
- Use semantic HTML in MDX files
- Keep markdown clean and readable
- Use the MDX component overrides in `mdx-components.tsx` for consistent styling

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Minimize client-side JavaScript

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels when needed
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make interactive elements keyboard accessible

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments only when explaining "why", not "what"
- Remove unused imports and code
- Keep functions small and focused

## Theme Consistency

- Background: Warm creamy white (`#FDFBF7`)
- Surface: Slightly darker cream (`#F2EFE9`)
- Text: Warm dark stone (`#292524`)
- Accent: Orange (`#EA580C`)
- Maintain this color palette throughout the site

## When Adding Features

1. **Question first**: Is this feature necessary?
2. **Keep it simple**: Can this be done with existing tools?
3. **Stay consistent**: Does this match the existing style?
4. **Test**: Does it work across different screen sizes?

## Avoid

- Over-engineering solutions
- Adding unnecessary abstractions
- Using complex state management when simple props work
- Hardcoding colors or values that should use theme variables
- Creating components that are too large or do too much
